ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Samples collected in glass 1 l bottles are purged at 60 °C for 1 hr in an ultrapure helium gas stream using an open loop arrangement. Volatile eluates are trapped onto selective adsorbents packed inside stainless steel tubes connected in series. After stripping at a flow rate of 100 mg/min for 60 min, the adsorbent tubes are disconnected, fitted with analytical desorption caps and sequentially desorbed for 10 min on a thermal desorber. The desorbed organics are trapped at 30 °C on a packed cold trap prior to flash volatilization of the volatiles across a fused silica transfer line onto a capillary column. The method separated over 200 organic compounds within 40 min using flame ionization and ion trap detection and is capable of quantitation down to 5 ng/l per component. The recoveries of 2,3-dimethylbutane from water at 30 and 60 °C were 50 and 85%, respectively.",

Flush victim's eyes with water or normal saline solution for 20 to 30 minutes while simultaneously calling a hospital or poison control center. Do not put any ointments, oils, or medication in the victim's eyes without specific instructions from a physician. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim after flushing eyes to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop.  SKIN: IMMEDIATELY flood affected skin with water while removing and isolating all contaminated clothing. Gently wash all affected skin areas thoroughly with soap and water. If symptoms such as redness or irritation develop, IMMEDIATELY call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital for treatment.  INHALATION: IMMEDIATELY leave the contaminated area; take deep breaths of fresh air. If symptoms (such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or burning in the mouth, throat, or chest) develop, call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital. Provide proper respiratory protection to rescuers entering an unknown atmosphere. Whenever possible, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) should be used; if not available, use a level of protection greater than or equal to that advised under Protective Clothing.  INGESTION: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. Volatile chemicals have a high risk of being aspirated into the victim's lungs during vomiting which increases the medical problems. If the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give 1 or 2 glasses of water to dilute the chemical and IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. (NTP, 1992)",

Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. For massive fire, use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2016)",

Mortality was observed in the low dose group (2 rats), and in the high dose group (3 rats) during the test; surviving animals were sacrificed 24 hours after administration of the final dose. Terminal body weights were statistically significantly (students t-test, p < 0.05) lower in high dose, but not in low dose groups. Mean kidney weights were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in both high and low dose groups. Gross necropsy observations in individual animals included lightly speckled cortical surfaces in kidneys, clear fluid in abdomens, reddened thymal lobes, congested lungs, scattered pale and dark foci on lungs, grey discoloration on livers, prominent lobular patterns on livers, diffuse reddening of cecums, reddened mediastinal lymph nodes, dark foci on nonglandular stomachs, moderately enlarged adrenals, hemorrhages in hearts, and mottled lungs, thymus glands and left kidneys. Histopathological findings in kidneys included hyaline droplet change (in 10 low, and 10 high dose rats), regenerative epithelium (in 10 low, and 10 high dose rats), and tubular dilatation with granular material (in 6 low, and 4 high dose rats). These kidney findings were used to calculate an index of hydrocarbon nephrotoxicity, defined as a sum of scores ranging from 1 to 4 in severity for each endpoint for the degree of hyaline droplet change, number of foci of regenerative epithelium, and the number of foci of tubular dilatation with granular material; values were 7.6 for the low dose group, 6.1 for the high dose group, and 3.0 for the saline treated control group. Additional histopathological findings in kidneys included mononuclear cell infiltrate (in 7 low, and 9 high dose rats), hyaline casts (in 5 low, and 2 high dose rats), and tubular mineralization (in 2 low dose rats).",

If released to soil, 2,3-dimethylbutane will have low mobility. Volatilization of 2,3-dimethylbutane may be important from moist and dry soil surfaces. Insufficient date are available to determine the rate or importance of biodegradation of 2,3-dimethylbutane in soil or water. If released to water, 2,3-dimethylbutane would adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. 2,3-Dimethylbutane would volatilize from water surfaces with estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake of 2.7 hours and 3.7 days, respectively. An estimated BCF value of 230 suggests that 2,3-dimethylbutane will bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. If released to the atmosphere, 2,3-dimethylbutane will exist as a vapor. Vapor-phase 2,3-dimethylbutane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 5.4 days. Vapor-phase 2,3-dimethylbutane is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with nitrate radicals with an estimated half-life of about 334 days. Exposure to 2,3-dimethylbutane will occur primarily through inhalation. (SRC)",

                "Description": "This section provides information on environmental biodegradation for this compound. Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Refueling emission profiles for 2,3-dimethylbutane/2-methylpentane were 2.58 and 2.26 wt% in the summer and winter, respectively and 4.17 and 3.2 wt% in Atlanta and Chicago respectively(2). The emission rate of 2,3-dimethylbutane is estimated to be 5 metric tons/day in a southern California mountain forest location impacted with urban photochemical smog(3). The profile for 2,3-dimethylbutane in gasoline engine exhaust (noncatalyst and catalyst equipped), unburned gasoline (whole and headspace vapors) was 0.6, 1.0, 1.1, and 1.1 wt%, respectively(4). 2,3-Dimethylbutane was identified in influent and effluent food refuse gas samples(5). The average 2,3-dimethylbutane contribution to emissions from 67 different vehicles was 0.6 wt% in Sydney, Australia(6). 2,3-Dimethylbutane content in moped exhaust with alkylate-based and reformate-based fuels was 1.2 and 1.5 wt% (alkylate: exhaust and fuel) and 0.48 and 0.6 (reformate: exhaust and fuel)(7).",
