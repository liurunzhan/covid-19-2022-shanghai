ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Avoid aiming straight or solid streams directly onto the product. If it can be done safely, move undamaged containers away from the area around the fire.  FIRE INVOLVING TANKS OR CAR/TRAILER LOADS: Fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned master stream devices or monitor nozzles. Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. For massive fire, use unmanned master stream devices or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2020)",

                "Description": "Peroxide-forming chemicals (PFCs) are chemicals that can \"auto-oxidize\" with atmospheric oxygen under ambient conditions to form organic peroxides (contains an -O-O- bond). Peroxide formation can be initiated by exposure to air, self-polymerization, or solvent impurities. Once formed, organic peroxides are sensitive to thermal or mechanical shock and can be violently explosive in concentrated solutions or as solids.",

Salivation was observed in 3 of 12 males and 2 of 12 females at 150 mg/kg bw/day and in all of 12 males and 12 females at 500 mg/kg bw/day. This sign was observed only for about 5 minutes after dosing at 150 mg/kg bw/day but up to 6 hours after dosing at 500 mg/kg bw/day. No significant changes of body weight, food consumption and hematological findings for both sexes and urinalysis findings for males were detected. Blood chemical examination showed a decrease in triglyceride in males at 150 and 500 mg/kg bw/day, and increases in total bilirubin in males at 500 mg/kg bw/day and in total bile acid in females at 50 mg/kg bw/day and in both sexed at 150 mg/kg bw/day and above. In males of the 500 mg/kg bw/day group, there was an increase in relative kidney weight. On histopathological examinations, no dose-related changes were observed. The increase in total bile acid observed in females at 50 mg/kg bw/day was not considered to be an adverse effect because of no accompanying changes. Therefore, based on salivation at 150 mg/kg bw/day, the NOAEL for repeated dose toxicity was considered to be 50 mg/kg bw/day for both sexes.[OECD; Screening Information Data Set for Cyclohexene, CAS #110-83-8 (October 2002).

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 89 mm Hg at 25 °C indicates cyclohexene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase cyclohexene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone, and nighttime nitrate radicals. The half-lives for these reactions in air are 6, 2, and 4 hours, respectively. Cyclohexene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight.  If released to soil, cyclohexene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 850. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.55X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. Cyclohexene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its extrapolated vapor pressure. A 0% theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum and the Japanese MITI test, suggests that biodegradation is not a fast process. If released into water, cyclohexene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 hour and 4 days, respectively. BCF values ranging from 23-45 measured in fish, suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate. Cyclohexene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to cyclohexene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where cyclohexene is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization of cyclohexene from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 4.55X10-2 atm-cu m/mole(4). Cyclohexene is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an extrapolated vapor pressure of 89 mm Hg(5).

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.55X10-2 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 hour and 4 days, respectively(SRC).

                          "String": "The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of cyclohexene with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals has been measured as 6.77X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 °C(1). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 6 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of cyclohexene with ozone has been measured as 2.04X10-16 cu-cm/molec-sec at 21 °C(2). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 molec/cu-cm(2). An experimental rate constant of 1.9X10-12 cu-cm/molec-sec at 25 °C(3) has been measured for the gas-phase reaction of cyclohexene with nighttime nitrate radicals. This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 4 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 2X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(4). Cyclohexene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(5). Cyclohexene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(5). Products from the reaction of cyclohexene with ozone are adipaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, pentanal, formic acid, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, 6-oxohexanoic acid, adipic acid, 5-oxopentanoic acid, and glutaric acid(6-8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",
