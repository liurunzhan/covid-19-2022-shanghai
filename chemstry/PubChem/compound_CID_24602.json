ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Since the response to treatment of human carcinomas growing in nude mice is deemed to be a good indicator of the potential clinical behavior of these tumors, we studied the influence of this stable isotope of hydrogen on the growth of xenotransplanted human carcinomas of various histologic types, grades, and primary sites. Seven-week-old Balb/c-nu/nu mice were inoculated subcutaneously, either with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas or with carcinomas of the large intestine. After tumor inoculation, the mice were given drinking water containing 30 atom% D2O. Heavy water effectively retarded the growth of the human carcinomas. At the end of the experiment, the weight of the tumors was reduced to values ranging from 22% to 65% of the control values. The reproducible antiproliferative effect was more conspicuous in poorly differentiated carcinomas than in moderately well-differentiated variants. Since animals in both groups, kept under identical conditions, drank the same amount of water and had similar body weights, the difference in tumor growth can be attributed to the moderate deuteration of the hosts.",

The major difficulty in assuring good vaccine coverage, especially in hot climates, is the thermostability of the vaccine. Several attempts have been made to stabilize the OPV with limited benefits. In this report, we describe a heavy water based stabilization procedure, which has been shown to increase the thermostability of the vaccine, notably at temperatures which are commonly encountered during usual transportation in conditions of cold chain failure. Safety considerations regarding the human use of heavy water containing bioproducts are discussed.",

These hyperthermic protectors blocked the induction of stress proteins during a 1-hour heat shock at 44 degrees C. The inhibitory effect of glycerol but not D2O on the induction of heat shock proteins could be overcome by increased temperature. By using transcriptional run-on assays of isolated nuclei and cDNA probes to detect hsp70- and hsp88-specific RNA transcripts, it was shown that the D2O and glycerol blocks occurred at or before transcriptional activation of the hsp70 and hsp88 genes. After heat-stressed cells were returned to 37 degrees C and the protectors were removed, heat shock proteins were inducible by a second heating. This result and the fact that the chemical stressor sodium arsenite induced stress proteins in glycerol medium indicated that the treatments did not irreversibly inhibit the induction pathways and that the stress response could be triggered even in the presence of glycerol by a stressor other than heat. In principle then, cells incurring thermal damage during a 1-hour heat shock at 44 degrees C in D2O or glycerol medium should be competent to respond by inducing heat shock proteins during a subsequent recovery period at 37 degrees C in normal medium. We found that heat shock proteins were not induced in recovering cells, suggesting that glycerol and D2O protected heat-sensitive targets from thermal damage. Evidence that the heat-sensitive target(s) is likely to be a protein(s) is summarized. During heat shocks of up to 3 hours duration, neither D2O nor glycerol significantly altered hsp23 gene activity, a constitutively expressed chicken heat shock gene whose RNA transcripts and protein products are induced by stabilization (increased half-life). During a 2-hour heat shock, glycerol treatment blocked the heat-induced stabilization of hsp23 RNA and proteins; however, D2O treatment only blocked RNA transcript stabilization, effectively uncoupling the hsp23 protein stabilization pathway from hsp23 RNA stabilization and transcriptional activation of hsp70 and hsp88 genes.",

Mice in which kaolin was injected into the cisterna magna were divided into two groups: 1) Group H, which had free access to H2O as tap water; and 2) Group D, which had free access to 30% D2O as tap water before and after kaolin injection. A distilled water-injected group, which had free access to H2O as tap water was designated the sham-operated group. The authors examined the effects of D2O within 28 days after injection on the development of hydrocephalus and intrameningeal fibrosis, as well as on the expression levels of several inflammatory and fibrogenic cytokines: transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, and interleukin (IL)-6. The cerebral ventricles were less expanded, and intrameningeal fibrosis was milder in Group D than in Group H. The proliferation of fibroblasts was assessed by applying the bromodeoxyuridine labeling index, which was lower in Group D than in Group H. Expression of TGFbeta1 in the macrophages, choroid plexus, and meninges was inhibited in Group D but not in Group H. The serum level of total TGFbeta1 was significantly lower in Group D than in Group H on Day 14, whereas the levels of FGF2, PDGF-BB, and IL-6 did not differ significantly among the groups. Administration of D2O prevented the development of kaolin-induced hydrocephalus in mice and inhibited intrameningeal fibrosis and upregulation of TGFbeta1.",

This is based in part on generation of free radicals. It is conceivable that deuterium in body fluids lessens the production of free radicals, thus preventing or diminishing the morphologic expression of pulmonary BLM toxicity. We therefore studied the effect of moderate deuteration of body fluids on BLM-induced lung damage in BALB/c-mice. In addition to conventional histopathological methods, we used a vertical sectioning design for stereological estimation of pulmonary volumes and surface areas. BLM (low/medium/high dose: 25/50/75 IU/kg body weight) was injected i.p. once a week for 6 weeks. Half the mice drank deuterated water before, during and after BLM treatment. Three weeks after the last injection, the lungs were fixed by airway instillation. Deuterated animals treated with BLM lacked signs of irreversible BLM-induced pulmonary damage. Conversely, focal sub-pleural fibrosis and fibrosing alveolitis were present in BLM-treated mice drinking tap water. Deuterated mice had stereological values for almost all lung parameters that were lower than in non-deuterated mice. The organ-specific advantage of deuteration was offset by marked enhancement of systemic toxicity of BLM. We conclude that (1) moderate concentrations of deuterium may prevent the development of fibrosing alveolitis in BLM-treated mice, possibly by reducing proliferation of alveolar fibroblasts, and, less probably, by impairing generation or enhancing capture of free radicals; (2) the toxicity of BLM was enhanced by ingestion of deuterium, resulting in morphological liver alterations and increased mortality.",

Eighteen male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, age 8 weeks, were divided into 3 groups of 6 animals each. Animals in group I were given water; group II, 8% fructose and group III, 8% fructose + 5% D20 as their drinking water for the next 15 weeks. Systolic blood pressure in the fructose treated rats was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than in animals on water after 2 weeks and remained higher throughout the study. At 15 weeks, systolic blood pressure, platelet cytosolic calcium, aortic calcium uptake and plasma glucose, insulin and triglycerides were significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the fructose treated rats compared with rats from other groups. Deuterium oxide given together with fructose prevented development of high blood pressure and the associated increase in platelet cytosolic calcium, aortic calcium uptake and plasma triglycerides. D20 treatment did not prevent fructose induced increases in plasma insulin and glucose. The parallel increase in systolic blood pressure, cytosolic free calcium, and in vascular calcium uptake suggests that an increased cytosolic free calcium is involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension. D20 prevents this hypertension by normalizing cytosolic free calcium.",

Seven-week-old BALB/c-nu/nu mice were inoculated subcutaneously with a poorly differentiated oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma, or with variants of carcinoma of the large intestine. After tumor inoculation, 3 subgroups of mice were treated by: (i) moderately deuterated drinking water; (ii) i.p. injections of 5-Fluoro-uracil (5-FU) or Bleomycin; (iii) a combination of deuterated drinking water and of the cytostatic drugs. Control mice were not treated. Heavy water delayed growth of all carcinoma variants. The cytostatic drugs slowed down the growth of the 2 poorly differentiated tumor variants. Conversely, 5-FU did not retard the growth of the moderately well differentiated colon carcinoma. Heavy water combined with either cytostatic drug showed synergistic effects in the 2 poorly differentiated tumor variants. The tumors of treated animals weighed 36% to 90% less than those of control animals. The antineoplastic effects were more conspicuous in poorly than in moderately well differentiated tumor variants. Cytokinetic parameters such as labelling indices following application of 5-125I-Iodo-2'deoxyuridine, and of Ki-67, a monoclonal antibody (MAb) directed against an antigen of proliferating cells, or mitotic indices and tumor volume doubling time, combined with the results of histologic evaluation of the tumors, suggested an underlying deuterium-induced prolongation of tumor-cell cycle times and a reduction of the growth fraction.",

In contrast to front-tail polarity as evoked by chemotactic peptides and microtubule-disassembling agents, D2O-based media produce non-polar neutrophils with many small or long surface projections. This phenotype is similar to that elicited by both phorbol myristate acetate and diacylglycerols, but the surface projections are smaller and more densely placed and are often associated with a single large projection. D2O-induced non-polar cells with surface projections perform continuous shape changes without front-tail polarity and without the unidirectional movement and cytoplasmic streaming seen in cells with front-tail polarity. Some of the cells show circus movements of a large projection indicating circular polarity. In neutrophils suspended in D2O, F-actin is shifted to the cell periphery, mainly into the surface projections of activated cells. The D2O-induced effects are reversed in H2O-based medium. D2O is dominant over the chemotactic peptide, N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP), colchicine and taxol in that the combined action of D2O with any of these agents results in the D2O-induced phenotype. In contrast, cytochalasin B alone and in combination with fMLP induces a considerable decrease of non-polar cells and an increase of spherical cells similar to non-stimulated cells in H2O-based medium. Earlier studies indicated that D2O acts on microtubules. Our results suggest that D2O may act on the microfilament system. Neutrophils suspended in D2O-based medium may represent a useful model to study the relationship between shapes, movements, and particular functions of these cells.",

A 2-hr incubation of HeLa monolayers with low concentrations of D2O (1%-25%) in the medium increased the frequency of multipolar divisions up to 20 times the control level. Substitution of 10% and 25% D2O for H2O induced changes in the proportions of mitotic phases. These changes could be fully reversed to the control pattern after 1 hr of recovery in non-deuterated medium. Fifty % D2O strongly inhibited, and 75% D2O blocked the cell cycle before prophase and at (pro-)metaphase. In cells treated with 50% D2O conspicuous morphological changes of the interphase chromatin as well as ultrastructural abnormalities of all mitotic phases were regularly observed. Overall, these results confirmed the antimitotic activity of deuterium oxide and revealed that it could also influence the cell cycle before mitosis. It is suggested that interference with diverse cellular constituents rather than a specific influence on microtubule turnover could be responsible for the disorganization of the cell cycle in HeLa cells by D2O.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of high hydrostatic pressure and deuterium oxide (D2O) on fertilized Rana pipiens eggs during the time of pronuclear migration. The eggs were either pulsed for six min with 3000, 5000, or 7000 psi or placed for ten min in 80% D2O between the time of second polar body emission and first cleavage. Both treatments disrupted male pronuclear migration as shown by eccentric first cleavage furrows. Treatment of eggs prior to pronuclear association resulted in haploid production. The androgenetic origin of the haploid embryos was demonstrated using morphological and isozymal markers produced by the cross Rana pipiens female x Rana utricularia male. Eggs treated with D2O also yielded embryos with neural defects identical to those following ultraviolet irradiation. This study complements the recent reports on pressure-suppression of the second polar body and of first cleavage by showing that the selective suppression of microtubular function between these two events produces an entirely different set of genetic and developmental consequences.",

In human, D2O has been used as the tracer to quantify total body water of the pregnant mothers. 30% or 50% D2O in tap water was administered to the pregnant mice (Jcl:ICR) from day 0 (G0) of gestation. In 30% D2O-treated group dams were sacrificed on G13, and on 11, 13 and 18 in 50% group. Distilled water was used as control. Live pups were observed the external malformations and measured the crown-rump length. Abnormal embryos were studied on the histological and ultramicroscopic findings. D2O treated alive pups were observed the growth retardation in general. Effects of D2O on the development are as follows: 1) On G13, the incidences of resorptions were increased in a dose dependent manner (50% D2O:95.2%; 30% D2O:24.7%); 2) Incidence of alive pups in 30% D2O group was significantly lower (72.0%) than in control. In external malformations, the incidences of live embryos with abnormalities were significantly increased by D2O (G13-30%:11.9%; G11-50%:61.9%) and the neural tube defects were most frequently observed (G13-30%:9.0%; G11-50%:61.9%). The hypoplasia of the hip (G13-30%) and cystic form of the head and chest (G11-50%) were observed. This abnormal feature of the cystic embryo is very rare type of the congenital anomalies in mice. The results of the histological observations are as follows: 1) Degeneration of the neuroepithelium and the mesenchyme was observed in the affected lesion of the neural-tube-defect embryos; 2) Dilated blood vessels filled with the blood cells and bleeding lesion were observed around the neural tube; 3) Enlarged blood cells with the rich cytoplasm were observed; 4) Enlargement of the nuclear pores was observed in G11-50% D2O treated group.

To clarify these causal mechanisms we analyzed chromosomes in embryos from D2O-treated mice. Further, embryos of day 12 and 13 were studied histologically. Through SEM observation of the head of day 13 embryos with exencephaly, no significant difference was found between D2O-treated and non-treated mice. The number of metaphase cells of the neuroepithelium in growth-retarded (11.3%) or normal embryos (11.4%) were significantly more than those in the exencephaly (9.5%). Differentiation of neuroepithelial cells in growth-retarded embryos was delayed in comparison with normal embryos from control. Chromosomes of affected parts in embryos having external anomalies, such as exencephaly were analyzed. Total rate of chromosomal anomalies of 30% D2O-treated mice was 56.2%. This is higher than our previous data (whole embryo; 22.4%), and is caused by a high incidence of aneuploidy (53.1%) in comparison with our previous data (whole embryo; 9.1%). Polyploidy was rarely found, corresponding with results of histological studies. In these histological and chromosomal studies it is suggested that chromosomal anomalies induced by D2O derailed the morphogenesis of the embryos."
