Chronic (long-term) exposure of workers and rodents to naphthalene has been reported to cause cataracts and damage to the retina. Hemolytic anemia has been reported in infants born to mothers who \"sniffed\" and ingested naphthalene (as mothballs) during pregnancy. Available data are inadequate to establish a causal relationship between exposure to naphthalene and cancer in humans. EPA has classified naphthalene as a Group C, possible human carcinogen.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Naphthalene is used mainly as an intermediate in the synthesis of organic chemicals (plastics, insecticides, fungicides, etc.). It has been used as a household moth repellent. [ACGIH] Naphthalene is produced from incomplete combustion, e.g., burning fossil fuels, forest fires, and smoking cigarettes. It is present in jet and diesel fuel. Its use as a moth repellent has decreased since the introduction of p-dichlorobenzene. Naphthalene is one of the major components of creosote, and the highest concentrations in industrial environments occur in workplaces producing creosote-impregnated timbers. [See Reference #1]",

At an average content of around 10%, naphthalene represents the most important compound in high-temperature coal tar (coke-oven tar) in terms of quantity. It can already be concentrated to over 90% in primary tar distillation, in the naphthalene fraction boiling between 210 and 220 Â°C, with a yield in excess of 90%. Further refining requires separation of the co-boiling compounds (phenols, nitrogen bases, benzo(b)thiophene, and other aromatic hydrocarbons). For production of technical naphthalene (e.g., mp 78.5 detg C), redistillation of the naphthalene fraction is sufficient. Generally, phenols are extracted with sodium hydroxide solution before distillation. Pure naphthalene (mp greater than or equal to 79.6 Â°C) is produced by, e.g., crystallization or hydrorefining.",

The bicyclic aromatic fraction, with a boiling range of, e.g., 220 - 270 Â°C, is dealkylated under hydrogen pressure, either thermally above 700 Â°C, or catalytically in the presence of a chromium oxide/aluminum oxide or cobalt oxide/molybdenum oxide catalyst at 550 - 650 Â°C.

Flush victim's eyes with water or normal saline solution for 20 to 30 minutes while simultaneously calling a hospital or poison control center. Do not put any ointments, oils, or medication in the victim's eyes without specific instructions from a physician. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim after flushing eyes to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop.  SKIN: IMMEDIATELY flood affected skin with water while removing and isolating all contaminated clothing. Gently wash all affected skin areas thoroughly with soap and water. IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital for treatment after washing the affected areas.  INHALATION: IMMEDIATELY leave the contaminated area; take deep breaths of fresh air. IMMEDIATELY call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or burning in the mouth, throat, or chest) develop. Provide proper respiratory protection to rescuers entering an unknown atmosphere. Whenever possible, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) should be used; if not available, use a level of protection greater than or equal to that advised under Protective Clothing.  INGESTION: If the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give 1 or 2 glasses of water to dilute the chemical and IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center. Generally, the induction of vomiting is NOT recommended outside of a physician's care due to the risk of aspirating the chemical into the victim's lungs. However, if the victim is conscious and not convulsing and if medical help is not readily available, consider the risk of inducing vomiting because of the high toxicity of the chemical ingested. Ipecac syrup or salt water may be used in such an emergency. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. (NTP, 1992)",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Accordingly, should a registrant fail to implement any of the risk mitigation measures identified in this document, the Agency will take regulatory action to address the risk concerns from the use of naphthalene.

This is based on the inadequate data of carcinogenicity in humans exposed to naphthalene via the oral and inhalation routes, and the limited evidence of carcinogenicity in animals via the inhalation route. Using the 1996 Proposed Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment, the human carcinogenic potential of naphthalene via the oral or inhalation routes \"cannot be determined\" at this time based on human and animal data; however, there is suggestive evidence (observations of benign respiratory tumors and one carcinoma in female mice only exposed to naphthalene by inhalation). Additional support includes increase in respiratory tumors associated with exposure to 1-methylnaphthalene. At the present time the mechanism whereby naphthalene produces benign respiratory tract tumors are not fully understood, but are hypothesized to involve oxygenated reactive metabolites produced via the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase system. However, based on the many negative results obtained in genotoxicity tests, a genotoxic mechanism appears unlikely. HUMAN CARCINOGENICITY DATA: Available data are inadequate to establish a causal association between exposure to naphthalene and cancer in humans. Adequately scaled epidemiological studies designed to examine a possible association between naphthalene exposure and cancer were not located. Overall, no data are available to evaluate the carcinogenic potential in exposed human populations.",

Sham mice treated with corn oil vehicle were examined in a similar manner. An antibody to calcitonin gene-related peptide, a neuroendocrine cell marker, was used to identify the location, size, and number of PNECs and NEBs in the airways. After naphthalene treatment and epithelial repair, NEBs were significantly increased along the walls of the airways as well as on branch point ridges. The surface area covered by NEBs composed of 20 or fewer PNECs was significantly enlarged after naphthalene treatment compared with control NEBs of an equivalent cell number. The PNEC number per square millimeter was also increased more than threefold above control values after naphthalene treatment. ...",

Ultrastructural changes within excretory cells consisted of increased formation or accumulation of lipid droplets, increased occurrence of membrane bound dark bodies which became enlarged after 96 hr of exposure to naphthalene, distortion of the Golgi complex, and altered mitochondrial structure. An increase in the numbers of residual bodies was observed in napthalene-exposed ciliated cells, together with numerous lipid droplets.

Existing data on the rates of metabolism of xenobiotic compounds in fish were reviewed. Only five studies that relate metabolism reactions to enzyme activity existed: the oxidation of benzo(a)pyrene, fenitrothion, carbaryl, and naphthalene, and the glucuronidation of phenol. These have shown that in a few cases the metabolic rates can be correlated with enzyme activity. For example, in some fish the rates of oxidation of benzo(a)pyrene, fenitrothion, and carbaryl can be correlated with increases in aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity. This correlation was not seen in studies of the rates of oxidation of naphthalene. The /data suggest/ that there are very few data that relate in vivo metabolism rates of xenobiotic compounds in fish to the in vivo enzyme activity. In many cases where such data exist the in vivo metabolism data do not correlate well with the enzyme activity data.",

Dams & fetuses were examined for signs of toxicity & teratogenicity. Each group contained 25-26 pregnant dams. Naphthalene admin produced clinical signs of toxicity. All doses of naphthalene caused lethargy, slow breathing, prone body posture, & rooting, but the effects subsided in the 50 & 150 mg/kg/day groups before the end of the treatment period. Clinical toxicity persisted throughout dosing in rats treated with 450 mg/kg/day naphthalene. Maternal mortality was low & limited to 2 animals in the 50 mg/kg/day group. Based upon the absence of maternal deaths at the higher doses, the association between naphthalene toxicity & maternal deaths at the 50 mg/kg/day dose is equivocal. Pregnancy rate, gravid uterine weight & liver weight (absolute & relative) were unaffected by naphthalene treatment. Naphthalene caused significant deficits in maternal body weight gain during the treatment period. Relative to the control group, the 150 mg/kg/day group showed a 31% reduction in weight gain during treatment as compared to a 53% reduction in the 450 mg/kg/day group. Post-treatment weight gain from gestational day 15 through sacrifice on gestational day 20 also remained significantly below controls in these two groups. Body weights were correspondingly reduced from gestational days 9-20. Maternal body weights & weight gains were unaffected by 50 mg/kg/day naphthalene. Maternal food & water consumption (absolute & relative) in the two highest dose groups were initially suppressed on gestational days 6-9. But unlike the effects on weight, the deficits in food & water intake were transient & confined to gestational days 6-9. Water consumption also displayed a transient incr on gestational days 9-12. Naphthalene was not fetotoxic or teratogenic. The avg number of corpora lutea/dam, implantation sites/litter, & live fetuses/litter were within 95-102% of controls in all treatment groups. Average fetal body weight was similarly unaffected by naphthalene. The results from this study indicate that naphthalene causes maternal toxicity expressed as CNS depression, decreased body weight, & altered food & water consumption. The maternal NOAEL was <50 mg/kg/day. Fetal growth, viability, & morphological development were not significantly affected by naphthalene, even at doses which caused significant maternal toxicity. However, statistically significant trends toward decreased fetal weight & increased malformation incidence suggest that the high dose (450 mg/kg/day) may be just below a significant LOAEL for developmental effects.",

Naphthalene (0, 20, 80, or 120 mg/kg/day) was administered in corn oil by gavage to pregnant rabbits during the major period of organogenesis (gestational days 6-19). ... There was no maternal mortality in the control or naphthalene groups & each group contained 20-23 pregnant does at necropsy. Maternal body weights in the naphthalene-treated groups were comparable to controls at all gestational ages. Maternal corrected gestational weight gain & food consumption in all three naphthalene groups was also comparable to controls throughout gestation. Exam of the uterine contents revealed that naphthalene was not fetotoxic. Avg live litter size & average fetal body weight in the naphthalene-treated groups were normal. There was no effect of naphthalene on the incidence of malformations (external, visceral, or skeletal). The incidence of variations or defects (fetuses with one or more malformation or variation) on a per fetus or litter basis was similarly unaffected in the naphthalene-treated groups. The results from this study provide no definitive evidence for naphthalene being toxic to the fetus or doe at doses as high as 120 mg/kg/day. Higher doses were not examined in this study due to the reported incidence of 40% maternal mortality following admin of 150 mg/kg/day naphthalene to pregnant rabbits in a range-finding study ... .",

Naphthalene was found in various species marine algae and in cork samples from camphor trees, us  found in oak, ash and hazel leaves, and has been detected in needles from Pinus pinea and needles from Pinus pinaster. Naphthalene has been detected in plants such as catnip, saffron, and clove. Naphthalene is also a component of crude oil. The largest releases of naphthalene result from the combustion of wood and fossil fuels or the production of coal tar. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.085 mm Hg at 25 Â°C indicates naphthalene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase naphthalene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and with nitrate radicals; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 14-16 and 60 hours, respectively. If released to soil, naphthalene is expected to have high to no mobility based upon Koc values of 112 to 9,333, depending on the nature of the soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. The estimated volatilization half-life for naphthalene from soil is 1.1 days, and 14 days when incorporated at a depth of 1 cm and 10 cm, respectively. Naphthalene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. In soils previously exposed to naphthalene or other PAHs, half-lives of 2-18 days have been reported, due to biodegradation. If released into water, naphthalene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Naphthalene has been shown to biodegrade in water with half-lives ranging from about 0.8 to 43 days. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 hours and 5 days, respectively. BCF values of 36.5-714 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Photolysis in sunlit surface waters may be an important fate process based upon an aqueous photolysis half-life of 71 hours. Occupational exposure to naphthalene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where naphthalene is produced or used. The most likely pathway by which the general public is exposed to naphthalene is by inhalation due to the release of this substance from combustion fuels, moth repellents, and cigarette smoke. Monitoring data also indicate that the general population may be exposed to naphthalene via ingestion of food and drinking water, although these pathways are considered minor when compared to inhalation.

The lag period for naphthalene degradation decreased as groundwater was more polluted with fuel oil; the lag period was 1.2 and 1.9 days in heavily polluted and slightly polluted water, respectively versus 12 days for unpolluted water(6). Approximately 70% of naphthalene was lost in a pilot-scale municipal wastewater treatment plant due to biodegradation(7). In water, bacteria can utilize naphthalene only when it is in the dissolved state(8).

The half-life of naphthalene was reported as 7, 24, 63, and 1700 days in an oil polluted estuarine stream, clean estuarine stream, coastal waters and a gulf stream near Georgia, respectively(4). A half-life of 9 days in water near a coal-coking wastewater discharge was also reported(5). In water from the Alaskan Continental Shelf degradation rates averaged 0.5%/week; however, when nutrient levels are lower as in late spring-early summer (after algae blooms), the degradation rate is reduced(6). In a mesocosm experiment using Narragansett Bay, RI seawater, the half-life in late summer was 0.8 days and is principally due to biodegradation(7). Biodegradation half-life of naphthalene was 43 days in microbe-supplemented filtered Lake Superior Harbor water and 39 days in nutrient and  microbe-supplemented water(8).",

The latter case indicates that some species of ubiquitous  micro flora present in clean groundwater is capable of degrading naphthalene(3). Naphthalene was found to biodegrade anaerobically in a Fe(III)-reducing, petroleum-contaminated sediment from an aquifer in Bemidji, MN; degradation was not found in methanogenic conditions or in Fe(III)-reducing sediments from other aquifers(4). In a sulfate reducing enriched culture of contaminated sediment, naphthalene was biodegraded to 2-naphthoic acid, which was further reduced to derivatives of 2-naphthoic acid(5). Naphthalene biodegraded 8, 8, and 22% in anoxic coal tar contaminated Boston Harbor sediment in 105, 220 and 342 days, respectively(6). Naphthalene at 7 mg/L degraded to undetectable levels in 45 days with a 2 week lag time, under denitrifying conditions (anaerobic with 75 mg nitrate/L)(7). Little degradation occurred in 50 days under anaerobic conditions(7). Biodegradation  occurred in groundwater contaminated with creosote(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Naphthalene was identified in 9 of 15 groundwater samples at 0.02-12 mg/L at the Gas Works Park Seattle, WA, which were sites of coal and oil gasification plants that ceased operation in 1956(2). Naphthalene was identified, not quantified, in <5% of the 208 groundwater sites sampled in the US(3). Ground water samples taken Dec 12-21, 2000 from a site impacted by leaking gasoline underground storage tanks in Glassboro, NJ contained naphthalene at 440-710 ug/L(4). Naphthalene was detected at 0.1 to 150 ppb in groundwater near gasoline storage facilities in East Anglica, England(5). Maximum naphthalene concentrations of 40-1100 ug/L were observed in groundwater near a leaking gasoline storage tank in Perth, Australia(6).",

Occupational exposure to naphthalene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where naphthalene is produced or used(SRC). A NIOSH survey of worker exposures to polyaromatic hydrocarbons at a petroleum refinery in Tulsa, Oklahoma reported air concentrations of naphthalene as high as 10.2 ug/cu m in an area sample and 19.3 ug/cu m for a personal sample(2). Naphthalene levels of 11.35-1,120 ug/cu m (vapor-phase) and 0-44 ug/cu m (particulate-phase) were reported in a coke plant(3). The most likely pathway by which the general public is exposed to naphthalene is by inhalation due to the release of this substance from combustion fuels, moth repellents, and cigarette smoke(2). Monitoring data also indicate that the general population may be exposed to naphthalene via ingestion of food and drinking water, although these pathways are considered minor as compared to inhalation(SRC).",
