For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Furthermore, within 24 hours of administration, downstream mediators of the MAPK pathway were inhibited.  The melanoma approval for use with Mekinist is based on results from COMBI-AD, a Phase III study of 870 patients with Stage III BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive melanoma treated with Tafinlar + Mekinist after complete surgical resection. Patients received doses of Tafinlar (150 mg BID) + Mekinist (2 mg QD) combination (n = 438) or matching placebos (n = 432). After a median follow-up of 2.8 years, the primary endpoint of relapse-free survival (RFS) was met.  Thus, Tafinlar in combination with Mekinist treats melanoma.    In the case of thyroid cancer, Dabrafenib plus Trametinib is the first regimen demonstrated to have potent clinical activity in BRAF V600E–mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer and is well tolerated. These findings represent a meaningful therapeutic advance for this orphan disease.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The most common side effects of Daretinib (Tafinlar) as a single agent include: hyperkeratosis, headache, pyrexia, arthralgia, papilloma, alopecia, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome.  The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) for Tafinlar in combination with [DB08911] are pyrexia, chills, fatigue, rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, peripheral edema, cough, headache, arthralgia, night sweats, decreased appetite, constipation, and myalgia.  The following is a list of toxicities that may occur with the combination of Daretinib and [DB08911]:  **New primary malignancies**: These may occur when Tafinlar is administered as a single agent or in combination with [DB08911]. Monitor patients for new malignancies prior to initiation of therapy, while on therapy, and following discontinuation of TAFINLAR or the combination therapy. Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Melanoma: Increased cell proliferation can occur with BRAF inhibitors.  **Hemorrhage:** Major hemorrhagic events can occur in patients receiving TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib. Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding.   **Venous Thromboembolism**: Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can occur in patients receiving the drug combination.  **Cardiomyopathy **: Assess LVEF before treatment with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib, after one month of treatment, then every 2 to 3 months thereafter.   **Ocular toxicities**: Perform an ophthalmologic evaluation for any visual disturbances.   **Serious Febrile Reactions:** Incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib.   **Serious Skin Toxicity:** Monitor for skin toxicities and for secondary infections. Discontinue for intolerable Grade 2, or Grade 3 or 4 rash not improving within 3 weeks despite the interruption of TAFINLAR.   **Hyperglycemia:** Monitor serum glucose levels in patients with pre-existing diabetes or hyperglycemia.   **Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency**: Closely monitor for hemolytic anemia.   **Embryofetal Toxicity**: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus. TAFINLAR may render hormonal contraceptives less effective and an alternative method of contraception should be used.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",
