When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Ozone deposition velocity was lower than determined with whole plants kept in darkness. It declined continuously during exposure to the gas and showed a recovery effect after an interruption of the fumigation. It incr with the moisture content of the cuticles and decr when the ozone concn in the surrounding air was raised. The deposition velocity was much higher than cuticular ozone permeance at equiv ozone concn. Due to the ozone decay in the cuticle, ozone permeance was much lower in thick than in thincuticles. Even with the most permeable cuticles, ozone uptake under natural conditions is smaller than the flux through open stomata by a factor of at least 10,000.",

Ozone uptake rates were proportional to the ozone concn up to 1500 nl/l. During a light-induced incr in transpiration and in carbon dioxide uptake rates, the ozone uptake rate also increased. The leaf gas phase diffusion resistance (stomatal plus boundary layer) to water vapor was calculated and converted to the resistance to ozone multiplying it by the theoretical ratio of diffusion coefficients for water vapor and ozone in air (1.67). The ozone concn in intercellular air spaces calculated from the ozone uptake rate and diffusion resistance to ozone scattered around zero (0.43 to -7.55 umol/cu m). The ozone concn in intercellular air spaces was measured directly by supplying ozone to the leaf from one side and measuring the equilibrium concn above the other side and it was found to be zero. Total leaf resistance to ozone was proportional to the gas phase resistance to water vapor with a coefficient of 1.68.",

Filtration efficiencies were typically 70-90%, showing decreasing efficiency with increasing flowrate. Ozone generation rates were about 3 ug/s. Scans of the aerosol concn on the downwind face of the electronic air cleaner were used to locate, then eliminate, areas of aerosol sneakage. Sneakage was detected along the top and bottom of the electronic air cleaner face, apparently due to incomplete aerosol charging for aerosol passing near the ends of the ionizing wires. Areas away from the top and bottom had near-zero aerosol penetration. Based on these results, the inlet to the electronic air cleaner was masked to eliminate airflow through the sneakage areas. The resultant efficiency of the masked electronic air cleaner was nearly 100% for particles larger than 0.1 micrometer diameter; however, the filtration efficiency for particles smaller than 0.1 um was not significantly affected by masking.",

Signs and Symptoms of Acute Ozone Exposure: Signs and symptoms of acute exposure to ozone may be severe and include irritation and burns of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. An increased respiratory rate, shallow breathing, cough, dyspnea (shortness of breath), bronchitis, pulmonary edema, and pulmonary hemorrhage may occur. Tachycardia (rapid heart rate) and hypotension (low blood pressure) may be observed. Neurologic effects include fatigue, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, exhiliration, and depression. Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia may occur. Eye exposure may result in conjuctivitis (red, inflamed eyes).  Emergency Life-Support Procedures: Acute exposure to ozone may require decontamination and life support for the victims. Emergency personnel should wear protective clothing appropriate to the type and degree of contamination. Air-purifying or supplied-air respiratory equipment should also be worn, as necessary. Rescue vehicles should carry supplies such as plastic sheeting and disposable plastic bags to assist in preventing spread of contamination.  Inhalation Exposure: 1. Move victims to fresh air. Emergency personnel should avoid self-exposure to ozone. 2. Evaluate vital signs including pulse and respiratory rate, and note any trauma. If no pulse is detected, provide CPR. If not breathing, provide artificial respiration. If breathing is labored, administer oxygen or other respiratory support. 3. Obtain authorization and/or further instructions from the local hospital for administration of an antidote or performance of other invasive procedures. 4. Transport to a health care facility.  Dermal/Eye Exposure: 1. Remove victims from exposure. Emergency personnel should avoid self- exposure to ozone. 2. Evaluate vital signs including pulse and respiratory rate, and note any trauma. If no pulse is detected, provide CPR. If not breathing, provide artificial respiration. If breathing is labored, administer oxygen or other respiratory support. 3. Remove contaminated clothing as soon as possible. 4. If eye exposure has occurred, eyes must be flushed with lukewarm water for at least 15 minutes. 5. THOROUGHLY wash exposed skin areas with soap and water. 6. Obtain authorization and/or further instructions from the local hospital for administration of an antidote or performance of other invasive procedures. 7. Transport to a health care facility.  Ingestion Exposure: No information is available. (EPA, 1998)",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Aniline in a atmosphere of ozone produces a white galatinous explosive ozobenzene [Mellor 1:911. 1946-47]. A mixture of ether and ozone forms aldehyde and acetic acid and a heavy liquid, ethyl peroxide, an explosive [Mellor 1:911. 1946-47]. Severe explosions occur attempting to form tribromic octaoxide from bromine and ozone [Mellor 2, Supp. 1:748. 1956]. Mixtures of ozone and dinitrogen pentaoxide are flammable or explosive [Mellor 8, Supp. 2:276. 1967]. Ozone and ethylene react explosively [Berichte 38:3837]. Nitrogen dioxide and ozone react with the evolution of light, and often explode [J. Chem. Phys. 18:366 1920]. Contact of very cold liquefied gas with water may result in vigorous or violent boiling of the product and extremely rapid vaporization due to the large temperature differences involved. If the water is hot, there is the possibility that a liquid \"superheat\" explosion may occur. Pressures may build to dangerous levels if liquid gas contacts water in a closed container, [Handling Chemicals Safely 1980].",

Additional groups of male F344/N rats were administered injections of 4-(N-methyl-Nnitrosamino)-1 -(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) (~99% pure) ... for 2 years. ... 2 YEAR OZONE STUDY IN RATS: ... Groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats were exposed to 0, 0.12, 0.5, or 1.0 ppm ozone by inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days/wk, for 105 wk. LIFETIME OZONE STUDY IN RATS: For this study, rats were exposed to 0.5 and 1.0 ppm ozone for an additional 6 mo to determine the effect of extended exposure on neoplasm incidence. Groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats were exposed to 0, 0.5, or 1.0 ppm ozone by inhalation for 6 hr/day, 5 days/wk, for 125 wk. 2 YEAR OZONE STUDY IN MICE: ... Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 0.12, 0.5, or 1.0 ppm ozone by inhalation for 6 hr/day, 5 days/wk, for 105 wk. LIFETIME OZONE STUDY IN MICE: ... Groups of 50 male and 50 female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 0, 0.5, or 1.0 ppm ozone by inhalation for 6 hr/day, 5 days/wk, for 130 wk. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2 yr and lifetime inhalation studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of ozone in male or female F344/N rats exposed to 0.12, 0.5, or 1.0 ppm. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of ozone in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of ozone in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma. ...",

Coefficients of the form delta ln[O3]/delta ln[X] and delta ln[OH]/delta ln[X], where [X]= flux of CH4, CO, NO, stratospheric O3, and H2O have been calculated for a number of chemically coherent regions (e.g. nonpolluted continental, nonpolluted marine, urban) at low and middle latitudes. Sensitivities in O3 and OH vary with regional emissions patterns and are nonlinear within a given region as [X] changes. In most cases incr CH4 an CO emissions will suppress OH (neg coefficients) in incr O3 (pos coefficients) except in areas where NO and O3 influenced by pollution are sufficient to incr OH. Stratospheric O3 depletion will tend to decr O3 (except in high NOx areas) and incr OH through enhanced UV photolysis. Incr levels of water vapor (one possible outcome of a global warming) will also decr O3 and incr OH. In most regions, NO, CO and CH4 emission incr will suppress OH and incr O3, but these trends may be opposed by stratospheric O3 depletion and climate change. A regional survey of OH and O3 levels suggests that the tropics have a pivotal role in determining the earth's future oxidizing capacity.",

Variations in ozone levels are highly correlated over distances of several hundred kilometers in the East, indicating that high values are associated with episodes of large spatial scale, > 600,000 sq km. There were 10 and 7 such episodes in 1978 and 1979, respectively, between the mo of Apr and Sept; they persisted for 3-4 days, on avg, with a range of 2-8 days, and were most common in Jun. Daily max ozone values exceeded 90 ppb at over half the sites during these episodes and were often > 120 ppb at one or more sites. An analysis of the meteorology for each episode shows that they occurred preferentially in the presence of weak, slow-moving, and persistent high-pressure systems. Two episodes that occurred outside the summer half of the yr were associated with unseasonably warm weather; only 1 episode, in Mar 1978, appeared to reflect a major stratospheric intrusion. Concn of NOx at rural locations in the East are frequently high enough (> 1 ppb) to permit significant photochemical formation of ozone. It is clear that rural ozone in the East in spring and summer is severely impacted by anthropogenic emissions of NOx and hydrocarbons, and that ozone episodes occur when the weather is particularly conducive to photochemical formation of ozone. Ozone episodes were present on 23% of days in May-Aug in the East in 1978-1979.",

The mean resistance was 4190 + or - 840 s/m, which is higher (slower destruction) than most previous estimates for seawater. Flux and mean measurements throughout the marine boundary layer were used to estimate the net rate of in-situ photochemical production/destruction of ozone. Averaged over the flights, ozone concn was found to be near steady state, and a net photochemical destruction of 0.02 to 0.07 ng/cu m/sec was diagnosed. Ozone vertical distributions above the boundary layer showed a strongly layered structure with very sharp gradients.",

The low abundance of O3 in the tropics is a result of the balance between photochemical production and transport out of the region. The seasonal behavior at high latitudes, as evident from the springtime maxima, results from a balance between photochemical removal and transport into the region.",

The mean resistance was 4190 + or - 840 s/m, which is higher (slower destruction) than most previous estimates for seawater. Flux and mean measurements throughout the marine boundary layer were used to estimate the net rate of in situ photochemical production/destruction of ozone. Averaged over the flights, ozone concn was found to be near steady state, and a net photochemical destruction of 0.02 to 0.07 ng/cu m/sec was diagnosed. Ozone vertical distributions above the boundary layer showed a strongly layered structure with very sharp gradients.",

Max avg hourly O3 concn peaked near 1500 hr for days > 0.06 ppm with minimum values near 0600 hr. Highest concn were observed when the wind was blowing from the northwest from the Seattle area.",

When daily peak hourly average ozone concentrations and daily peak hourly average nonmethane hydrocarbon concentrations were plotted, it was demonstrated that essentially any concentration of ozone can result from any concentration of hydrocarbons. Additionally, low concentrations of hydrocarbons were not associated with concurrent low levels of ozone. At very high hydrocarbon levels, ozone levels were likely to be below the standard of 120 ppb, whereas at very low hydrocarbon levels ozone levels were likely to be high. The relationship between ozone and nitrogen oxides were examined (daily peak hourly averages) and trends similar to those with ozone and hydrocarbon concentrations were noted. Ozone concentrations tended to increase as values of the hydrocarbons to nitrogen oxides ratio decreased. Ozone concentrations increased with increasing air temperature.",
