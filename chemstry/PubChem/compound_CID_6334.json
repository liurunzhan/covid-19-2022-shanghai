When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Natural gas plant production of propane primarily involves extracting materials such as propane and butane from natural gas to prevent these liquids from condensing and causing operational problems in natural gas pipelines. Similarly, when oil refineries make major products such as motor gasoline and heating oil, some propane is produced as a by-product of those processes. It is important to understand that the by-product nature of propane production means that the volume made available from natural gas processing and oil refining cannot be adjusted when prices and/or demand for propane fluctuate.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

CAUTION: Hydrogen (UN1049), Deuterium (UN1957) and Hydrogen, refrigerated liquid (UN1966) burn with an invisible flame. Hydrogen and Methane mixture, compressed (UN2034) may burn with an invisible flame.  SMALL FIRE: Dry chemical or CO2.  LARGE FIRE: Water spray or fog. Move containers from fire area if you can do it without risk.  FIRE INVOLVING TANKS: Fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles. Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. Do not direct water at source of leak or safety devices; icing may occur. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. For massive fire, use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2016)",

If possible, turn leaking containers so that gas escapes rather than liquid. Use water spray to reduce vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. Avoid allowing water runoff to contact spilled material. Do not direct water at spill or source of leak. Prevent spreading of vapors through sewers, ventilation systems and confined areas. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. CAUTION: When in contact with refrigerated/cryogenic liquids, many materials become brittle and are likely to break without warning. (ERG, 2016)",

They must be coupled with refrigeration systems to cool the product ... to a temp equal to the product's boiling point @ the operating pressure of the tanks. Vapors are generally recondensed by refrigeration and returned to the tanks. 3) In frozen earth storage of propane, the walls and bottom of a pit in the ground are frozen and a dome is constructed over the pit. The pressure in the storage cavern is maintained @ nearly atmospheric pressure by refrigeration systems that cool the product to its boiling point @ storage pressure. Heat leaks into the cavity and vaporizes some of the propane; the vapor that is formed is compressed, cooled, and returned to the pit as liquid by the refrigeration system. ... 4) Underground storage caverns, which operate @ approx formation temp and @ the corresponding /liquified petrolem gas (LPG)/ vapor pressure ... must be of sufficient depth to develop an overburden pressure greater than the vapor pressure of the stored liquid.

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The blast occurred less than half an hour after an all-terrain vehicle (ATV), driven by a minor without the owner's permission, damaged two above-ground propane pipes and a fire resulting from that accident engulfed the tank. The explosion that occurred at the farm is known as a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion or BLEVE. Tank fragments produced by the BLEVE killed two volunteer fire fighters. In addition, seven other emergency response personnel were injured, and several buildings were damaged by the blast. ... The propane storage and handling system was installed at the farm in 1988. When the tank system was installed, Iowa law provided that the 1979 edition of the National Fire Protection Association's Standard for the Storage and Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases (NFPA 58) governed the installation. ... The propane system at the farm did not comply with NFPA 58 in two significant respects that contributed to the incident: Above ground piping was not protected from potential damage from vehicles, and the liquid propane outlet pipe downstream from an excess flow valve was too narrow in diameter. Fire fighter training for responding to BLEVEs was /also/ inadequate. Some training materials provided to the fire fighters led them to believe that they would be protected from a propane tank explosion by positioning themselves to the sides of the tank and by avoiding the areas extending from the two ends of the tank. As a consequence, fire fighters were positioned too close to the sides of the burning propane storage tank when it exploded. ... A contributing cause /was that/ ... the State Fire Marshal should have received a plan of the farm's propane system prior to its installation in 1988. The State Fire Marshal had no record of the farm's system, however. Iowa law did not specifically designate which party -- the owner or the installer of a large propane tank facility -- was required to notify the State Fire Marshal. In addition, the State Fire Marshal did not have a program in place to adequately monitor or inspect large propane storage facilities.",

The effects of propane /were studied/ in guinea pigs exposed to 24,000-29,000 ppm and 47,000-55,000 ppm propane for periods of 5, 30, 60, and 120 min; at the lower concn, irregular breathing was observed and at the higher concn, tremors were evident during the first 5 min of exposure. Stupor was commonly observed in the animals exposed for longer periods of time (up to 2 hr). All animals recovered from the propane exposure and there were no pathological signs of organ toxicity at necropsy. In these studies, a /CNS depressant/ ... effect for propane was not seen until exposure levels were about 50,000 ppm. In contrast, /other studies showed/ n-butane caused anesthesia in mice within 1 min at 22,000 ppm and caused death in dogs at 20,000-25,000 ppm. Therefore, propane is much less toxic than its next higher homolog, n-butane.[Snyder, R. (ed.) Ethel Browning's Toxicity and Metabolism of Industrial Solvents. 2nd ed. Volume 1: Hydrocarbons.

Combustion of polyethylene and gasoline, waste incinerators as well as disposal of products associated with the petroleum and natural gas industries may also contribute to its release into the environment. Propane is a component of natural gas and crude petroleum. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 7,150 mm Hg at 25 Â°C indicates propane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase propane will be degraded in the atmosphere by a reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 days. Propane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, propane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 460. Propane is readily degraded by soil bacterium; within 24 hr propane was oxidized to acetone. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.07X10-1 atm-cu m/mole. Propane will volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, propane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation in water is not expected to be an important environmental fate process; after 192 hr, the trace concentrations of propane contained in gasoline remained unchanged for both a sterile control and a mixed culture sample collected from ground water contaminated with gasoline. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 41 min and 2.6 hours, respectively. An estimated BCF of 13 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to propane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where propane is produced or used. Propane is widely detected in air. The most likely pathway by which the general public is exposed to propane is by inhalation due to the release of this substance from natural gas and crude oil emissions.

According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 13.1(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

Gas-phase propane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.15X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 Â°C(3). Propane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(4).",

Once the fatty acid is produced, it is degraded into 2-carbon units via the beta-oxidation pathway. ... Another pathway for n-alkane degradation that is encountered less often is the oxidation of both terminal carbons to form a dioic acid with subsequent beta-oxidation. Subterminal oxidation of the 2-carbon atom is seen mainly in C3-C6 alkanes. ... A dehydrogenation of the n-alkane may also occur yielding an alkene which is then converted to an alcohol, although there is little evidence for this theory.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that propane is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 41 minutes(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 2.6 days(SRC). Propane's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of propane from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

Occupational exposure to propane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where propane is produced or used. Propane is widely detected in air(SRC). The most likely pathway by which the general public is exposed to propane is by inhalation due to the release of this substance from natural gas, natural gas food grills, and crude oil emissions. Monitoring data also indicate that the general population may be exposed to propane via ingestion of food and drinking water, although these pathways are considered minor when compared to inhalation(SRC).",
