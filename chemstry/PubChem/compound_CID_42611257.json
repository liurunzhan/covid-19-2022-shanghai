Approximately 90% of BRAF gene mutations involve a valine-to-glutamic acid mutation at residue 600 (V600E); the oncogene protein product, BRAF(V600E) kinase, exhibits a markedly elevated activity that over-activates the MAPK signaling pathway.

In a multicenter, open-label, phase 2 study, QT interval prolongation was evaluated in patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive, metastatic melanoma who were receiving vemurafenib (960 mg twice daily). A maximum mean corrected QT (QTc) interval change from baseline of 12.8 msec during the first month of treatment and 15.1 msec during the first 6 months of treatment was observed in these patients. The manufacturer does not recommend initiation of vemurafenib in patients with electrolyte abnormalities unresponsive to corrective measures or congenital long QT syndrome. In addition, concomitant use of vemurafenib with drugs known to prolong the QT interval (e.g., class Ia and III antiarrhythmic agents) is not recommended. ECGs and serum electrolyte concentrations, including concentrations of potassium, magnesium, and calcium, should be obtained prior to initiation of therapy or following dosage modification, and monitored 15 days following initiation of therapy, then monthly for the first 3 months of treatment, and then every 3 months thereafter or more often as clinically indicated. Interruption or discontinuance of vemurafenib may be necessary if increases in the QTc interval occur during therapy with the drug.",

                      "String": "Oncogenic mutations in RAS or BRAF can drive the inappropriate activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases, ERK1/2. In many cases tumor cells adapt to become addicted to this deregulated ERK1/2 signalling for their proliferation, providing a therapeutic window for tumor-selective growth inhibition. As a result, inhibition of ERK1/2 signalling by BRAF or MEK1/2 inhibitors is an attractive therapeutic strategy. Indeed, the first BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, has now been approved for clinical use, whilst clinical evaluation of MEK1/2 inhibitors is at an advanced stage. Despite this progress it is apparent that tumor cells adapt quickly to these new, targeted agents so that tumors with acquired resistance can emerge within 6-9 months of primary treatment. One of the major reasons for this is that tumor cells typically respond to BRAF or MEK1/2 inhibitors by undergoing a G1 cell cycle arrest rather than dying. Indeed, although inhibition of ERK1/2 invariably increases the expression of pro-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins, tumor cells undergo minimal apoptosis. This cytostatic response may simply provide the cell with the opportunity to adapt and acquire resistance. Here /the investigators/ discuss recent studies that demonstrate that combination of BRAF or MEK1/2 inhibitors with inhibitors of pro-survival BCL2 proteins is synthetic lethal for ERK1/2-addicted tumour cells. This combination effectively transforms the cytostatic response of BRAF and MEK1/2 inhibitors into a striking apoptotic cell death response. This not only augments the primary efficacy of BRAF and MEK1/2 inhibitors but delays the onset of acquired resistance to these agents, validating their combination in the clinic.",

However, resistance develops at a median time of approximately 6 months. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance is critical to develop strategies to prolong PFS and OS. Negative feedback mechanisms inherent in the MAPK pathway serve to modulate responses to these drugs. However, genetic changes develop within the tumor, which lead to reactivation of the MAPK and resistance to these drugs. The mechanisms that have been demonstrated in many patients by multiple investigators are (1) development of an activating mutation in NRAS, and (2) appearance of a BRAFV600E splice variant that encourages RAF dimerization. Several other mechanisms of resistance have also been described in individual patients or in preclinical models of resistance. In addition, there is evidence that activation of parallel pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, may represent another mechanism of resistance. Understanding the various mechanisms of resistance will inform our attempts to prevent resistance to RAF inhibitors.",

Moreover, the marked tumor regression and improved survival of late-stage BRAF-mutated melanoma patients in response to treatment with vemurafenib demonstrates the essential role of oncogenic BRAF in melanoma maintenance. However, as most patients relapse with lethal drug-resistant disease, understanding and preventing mechanism(s) of resistance is critical to providing improved therapy. Here /the researchers/ investigate the cause and consequences of vemurafenib resistance using two independently derived primary human melanoma xenograft models in which drug resistance is selected by continuous vemurafenib administration. In one of these models, resistant tumors show continued dependency on BRAF(V600E)?MEK?ERK signalling owing to elevated BRAF(V600E) expression. Most importantly, /the researchers/ demonstrate that vemurafenib-resistant melanomas become drug dependent for their continued proliferation, such that cessation of drug administration leads to regression of established drug-resistant tumours. /The researchers/ further demonstrate that a discontinuous dosing strategy, which exploits the fitness disadvantage displayed by drug-resistant cells in the absence of the drug, forestalls the onset of lethal drug-resistant disease. These data highlight the concept that drug-resistant cells may also display drug dependency, such that altered dosing may prevent the emergence of lethal drug resistance. Such observations may contribute to sustaining the durability of the vemurafenib response with the ultimate goal of curative therapy for the subset of melanoma patients with BRAF mutations.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

There was dose-dependent tumour growth stimulation of the xenograft tumours at doses higher than 25 mg/kg bid. The optimal dose of 75 mg/kg bid of vemurafenib caused a 103% induction of growth compared to the control (p=0.002). Immunohistochemistry showed staining of pERK only in the tumour samples treated with vemurafenib (75 mg/kg) as compared to the vehicle treated control group.

Two cases of panniculitis have been reported recently with two different selective BRAF inhibitors. /The reseaerchers/ report two cases of neutrophilic panniculitis in patients treated by vemurafenib for a metastatic melanoma. Clinical and biological examinations showed no indications for an immune nor an infectious cause of neutrophilic panniculitis.

One patient showed spontaneous recovery, whereas the other patient presented several recurrences of panniculitis.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 8.2X10-15 mm Hg at 25 °C indicates vernurafenib will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase vernurafenib will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Vernurafenib does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, the neutral species of vernurafenib is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 6.8X10+5. The estimated pKa of vernurafenib is 7.1, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-17 atm-cu m/mole. Vernurafenib is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, vernurafenib is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 310 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to vernurafenib may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where vernurafenib is produced or used. Exposure to vernurafenib among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug, an antineoplastic. (SRC)",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",
