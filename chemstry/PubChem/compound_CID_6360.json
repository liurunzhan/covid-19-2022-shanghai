If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

In vitro reactions with liver microsomes produced isopropanol from propane, sec-butanol from n-butane, and tert-butanol from iso-butane.

The newly developed analytical procedure is suitable for both emergency cases and forensic medicine investigations. Its practical applicability is illustrated with a forensic blood sample after acute inhalative intoxication with lighter fluid; case history and toxicological findings are included. Identification and quantitation of the analytes were performed using static headspace extraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In order to reconcile the large gas volumes injected (0.5 mL) with the narrowbore capillary column and thus achieve preconcentration, cold trapping on a Tenax sorbent followed by flash desorption was applied. Adequate retention and separation were achieved isothermally at 35 degrees C on a thick-film capillary column. Sample preparation was kept to a strict minimum and involved simply adding 2.5 uL of a liquid solution of 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane in t-butyl-methylether as an internal standard to aliquots of blood in a capped vial. Standards were created by volumetric dilution departing from a gravimetrically prepared calibration gas mixture composed of 0.3% of n-propane, 0.7% of iso-butane, and 0.8% of n-butane in nitrogen. In the forensic blood sample, the following concentrations were measured: 90.0 ug/L for n-propane, 246 ug/L for iso-butane, and 846 ug/L for n-butane.",

CAUTION: Hydrogen (UN1049), Deuterium (UN1957), Hydrogen, refrigerated liquid (UN1966) and Methane (UN1971) are lighter than air and will rise. Hydrogen and Deuterium fires are difficult to detect since they burn with an invisible flame. Use an alternate method of detection (thermal camera, broom handle, etc.) Vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back. Cylinders exposed to fire may vent and release flammable gas through pressure relief devices. Containers may explode when heated. Ruptured cylinders may rocket. (ERG, 2016)",

Hydrogen and Methane mixture, compressed (UN2034) may burn with an invisible flame.  SMALL FIRE: Dry chemical or CO2.  LARGE FIRE: Water spray or fog. Move containers from fire area if you can do it without risk.  FIRE INVOLVING TANKS: Fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles. Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. Do not direct water at source of leak or safety devices; icing may occur. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. For massive fire, use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2016)",

The models relate the applied vacuum, soil permeability, and spill composition to the vapor flowrates, velocities, mass removal rates, and residual composition changes with time. In this report the screening models and some sample calculations are presented .

It is used in organic synthesis, as a refrigerant, in motor fuels, and as aerosol propellant, as well as in synthetic rubber, and in instrument calibration fluid. HUMAN STUDIES: Isobutane is a simple asphyxiant. Acute exposure may cause tachypnea and tachycardia. In severe cases, hypotension, apnea, and cardiac arrest develop. Direct contact with the liquid produces chemical burns. Toxicologically, the vapor exerts no effect on skin and eyes. A case of ventricular fibrillation due to isobutane toxicity after unintentional inhalation of air freshener has been reported. The intentional inhalation of a volatile substance (\"sniffing\") causing euphoria and hallucinations is a form of substance abuse in children and adolescents with a high morbidity and mortality. Sudden death can be caused by cardiac arrhythmia, asphyxia or trauma. Fatal cases of isobutane sniffing of cigarette lighter refill containing isobutane has been reported. ANIMAL STUDIES: Studies in rabbits exposed through the eyes to undiluted hairspray containing 22% isobutane showed that irritation of the eye was immediately evident with transient iritis and mild conjunctivitis. Acute exposure in dogs to 55 mg/L isobutane was fatal, and 45 mg/L caused anesthesia. Two-hour exposures of mice to 41 mg/L isobutane caused death in 60% of the exposed animals, whereas exposure to 52 mg/L was lethal to 100% of the animals within an average of 28 min. Isobutane is a CNS depressant in the mouse at 15% in 60 min, and at 23% in 26 min. Isobutane caused apnea and finally cardiac arrest in anesthetized rats. Isobutane tested negative in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay.",

There being no untoward responses to these acute exposures, the eight volunteers were exposed repetitively to isobutane at concentrations of 500 ppm, 1, 2 or 8 hr per day, five days per week for two weeks. Then exposures to two mixtures of isobutane and propane for 1, 2 or 8 hr per day for two days were studied. During the investigation all subjects were kept under comprehensive medical surveillance. No untoward subjective responses or abnormal physiological responses occurred during or following these exposures. Special emphasis was placed on evaluating the cardiac and pulmonary response to these exposures through the use of continuous ECG telemetry and serial computerized spirometric measurements. The following serial laboratory studies were unaltered by the exposures: complete blood count, urinalysis, serum alkaline phosphatase, SGOT, LDH, serum bilirubin, blood sugar, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, BUN, spontaneous electroencephalogram, visual evoked response, a battery of cognitive tests, and an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test.",

Repetitive exposures to these four propellants were also without measurable untoward physiological effect with the exception of the eight male subjects repetitively exposed to 1000 ppm, F-11, who did show minor decrements in several of the cognitive tests. Of particular importance is the observation that none of the subjects showed any decrement in pulmonary function or alteration in cardiac rhythm as the result of exposure to concentrations of the gases or vapors far greater than encountered in the normal use of aerosol products in the home.",

A combination of the autopsy findings and the gas analysis results revealed that the cause of death was ventricular fibrillation induced by hard muscle exercise after gas inhalation in cases 1 and 2, and that the cause of death in case 3 might be hypoxia. It is possible that the victim in case 3 was under anesthetic toxicity of accumulated isobutane which is a minor component of liquefied petroleum gas.",

Isobutane is a component of natural gas. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2610 mm Hg at 25 °C indicates isobutane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase isobutane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7 hours. Isobutane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, isobutane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 250. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.19 atm-cu m/mole. Isobutane is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor. Isobutane reached 49% mineralization after 20 days using an activated sludge inoculum suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process under certain conditions in soil. If released into water, isobutane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Microcosm experiments designed to simulate natural estuaries reported half-lives for isobutane ranging from 16-26 days suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process under certain conditions in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 47 minutes and 3 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 30 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to isobutane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isobutane is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate the general population may be exposed to isobutane via inhalation of ambient air, particularly in areas with heavy vehicular traffic or dermal exposure to products such as gasoline and fuels, insect spray, window and glass cleaner, personal spray deodorant, and rug and upholstery cleaners containing isobutane.

Volatilization of isobutane from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.19 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 2610 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 48.8 mg/L(5). Isobutane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(4).

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.19 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 2610 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 48.8 mg/L(6). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 3 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 30(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Microcosm experiments designed to simulate natural estuaries reported half-lives for isobutane ranging from 16-26 days(8) suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process under certain conditions in water(SRC).",

The respective half-lives are 11 days and 23 days(SRC). The results indicate that gas exchange is the dominant removal mechanism for isobutane gases from the water column following a hypothetical input. Scaling up the predicted gas exchange rate constants (0.26/day and 0.017/day at 20 and 10 °C, respectively) so they are consistent with natural estuaries, the volatilization half-lives for isobutane from the water columns in natural estuaries(1) are estimated to be 4.4 and 6.8 days at 20 and 10 °C, respectively(SRC). Isobutane also biodegrades in the microcosm at a rate that is slower than for n-butane and falls between propane and ethane in susceptibility. Biodegradation of isobutane initially occurs with a half-lives of 16-26 days at 20 °C and 33-139 days at 10 °C, significantly slower than the loss predicted by gas exchange from typical natural estuaries. However, after a lag of 2-4 weeks, the biodegradation rate increases markedly so that in the case of chronic inputs, biodegradation can become the dominant removal mechanism(1).",

The removal rate constant of isobutane is 0.061/day (standard deviation 0.005/day) at 20 °C and 0.030/day (standard deviation 0.006/day) at 10 °C(1). The respective half-lives are 11 days and 23 days(SRC). The results indicate that gas exchange is the dominant removal mechanism for isobutane gases from the water column following a hypothetical input. Scaling up the predicted gas exchange rate constants (0.26/day and 0.017/day at 20 and 10 °C, respectively) so they are consistent with natural estuaries, the volatilization half-lives for isobutane from the water columns in natural estuaries(1) are estimated to be 4.4 and 6.8 days at 20 and 10 °C, respectively(SRC). Isobutane also biodegrades in the  microcosm at a rate that is slower than for n-butane and falls between propane and ethane in susceptibility. Biodegradation of isobutane is significantly slower than the loss predicted by gas exchange from typical natural estuaries. However, after a lag of 2-4 weeks, the biodegradation rate increases markedly so that in the case of chronic inputs, biodegradation can become the dominant removal mechanism(1).",

Isobutane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(5).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

No isobutane emissions were attributed to coatings and adhesives(5). Isobutane gasoline exhaust emissions in the U.K have been estimated to be 5.29 and 14.5 kilotonnes by two investigators, constituting respectively 2% and 4% of exhaust emissions(1,3). Isobutane is found in underwater hydrocarbon vent plumes from offshore production; the concn in one plume was 560 umol/L(7). Isobutane constituted 0.004% of municipal sanitary landfill gas at Palos Verdes, CA(2). The landfill was in the anaerobic phase. Isobutane was found in emissions from the combustion of waste PVC plastics under conditions of incomplete combustion but not under conditions of complete combustion(4). Isobutane is used in consumer products such as insect spray, window and glass cleaner, personal care and pet products, arts and craft products,  auto and home maintenance products and rug and upholstery cleaners(8,9) and may be released when these products are manufactured or used(SRC).",
