Thyroid cancer is a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the thyroid. Anaplastic thyroid cancer is a rare, aggressive type of thyroid cancer. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates there will be 53,990 new cases of thyroid cancer and an estimated 2,060 deaths from the disease in the United States in 2018.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

The following is a list of toxicities that may occur with the combination of Dabrafenib and Trametinib:  **New primary malignancies**: These may occur when Tafinlar is administered as a single agent or in combination with Trametinib. Monitor patients for new malignancies prior to initiation of therapy, while on therapy, and following discontinuation of TAFINLAR or the combination therapy. Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Melanoma: Increased cell proliferation can occur with BRAF inhibitors.  **Hemorrhage**: Major hemorrhagic events can occur in patients receiving TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib. Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding.  **Venous Thromboembolism**: Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can occur in patients receiving the drug combination.  **Cardiomyopathy**: Assess LVEF before treatment with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib, after one month of treatment, then every 2 to 3 months thereafter.  **Ocular toxicities**: Perform an ophthalmologic evaluation for any visual disturbances.  **Serious Febrile Reactions**: Incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased with TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib.  **Serious Skin Toxicity**: Monitor for skin toxicities and for secondary infections. Discontinue for intolerable Grade 2, or Grade 3 or 4 rash not improving within 3 weeks despite the interruption of TAFINLAR.  **Hyperglycemia**: Monitor serum glucose levels in patients with pre-existing diabetes or hyperglycemia.  **Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency**: Closely monitor for hemolytic anemia.  **Embryofetal Toxicity**: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus. TAFINLAR may render hormonal contraceptives less effective and an alternative method of contraception should be used.",
