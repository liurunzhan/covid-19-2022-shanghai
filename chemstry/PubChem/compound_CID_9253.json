The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

It may be used for simultaneous measurements, however, interactions between analytes may reduce breakthrough volumes and change desorption efficiencies. Interferences: At high humidity, breakthrough volumes may be reduced by as much as 50%.

Use of water spray when fighting fire may be inefficient. CAUTION: For mixtures containing alcohol or polar solvent, alcohol-resistant foam may be more effective.  SMALL FIRE: Dry chemical, CO2, water spray or regular foam.  LARGE FIRE: Water spray, fog or regular foam. Avoid aiming straight or solid streams directly onto the product. If it can be done safely, move undamaged containers away from the area around the fire.  FIRE INVOLVING TANKS OR CAR/TRAILER LOADS: Fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned master stream devices or monitor nozzles. Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. For petroleum crude oil, do not spray water directly into a breached tank car. This can lead to a dangerous boil over. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. For massive fire, use unmanned master stream devices or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2020)",

It is also used to produce a variety of analgesics, sedatives, hypnotics, antitumor agents, CNS depressants, prostaglandins, insecticides, and many other products. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Symptoms of exposure to high concentrations of cyclopentane include excitement, dizziness, confusion, coma, and possibly respiratory failure. Ingestion may cause irritation of the gastrointestinal tract and result in nausea and vomiting. 122 workers in the Italian shoe industry suffered polyneuropathy from glue solvents exposure. ANIMAL STUDIES: When applied to guinea pig skin, undiluted alicyclic hydrocarbons cause morphological changes (epidermal thickening) and altered epidermal soluble arginase activity. In the mice there is no safety margin between minimal CNS depressant concentration, loss of reflexes, and lethality, which all occurred at 110 mg/L. When ingested, there is a low to moderate aspiration hazard in mice. Inhalation of 8110 mg/L 6 hr per day for 12 weeks results in decreased body weight gains in female rats. The effects of cyclopentane on the ionic currents and electrical capacity of the squid giant axon membrane were that both the peak inward and steady-state outward currents were reduced reversibly.",

Both the peak inward and steady-state outward currents were reduced reversibly by each substance, though propane at 1 atm had very little effect. The membrane capacity at 100 kHz was reduced by all substances except propane at 1 atm. Na currents were recorded in intracellularly perfused axons before and during exposure to the hydrocarbons and the records were fitted with equations similar to those proposed by Hodgkin & Huxley (1952). Shifts in the curves of the steady-state activation and inactivation parameters (m infinity and h infinity) against membrane potential, changes in the peak heights of the activation and inactivation time constants (tau m and tau h) and reductions in the maximum Na conductance (gNa) have been tabulated. The effects of the various hydrocarbons and carbon tetrachloride on the parameters of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations suggest that the suppression of the Na current by these substances originates from several different phenomena. The underlying physico-chemical events are considered in the light of the observed capacity changes and of information on artificial pore-containing membranes.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 317.8 mm Hg at 25 °C indicates cyclopentane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase cyclopentane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.4 days. Cyclopentane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, cyclopentane is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 80. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.19 atm-cu m/mole. Cyclopentane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Cyclopentane was not biodegraded by microorganisms isolated from soil, indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental date process in soil. If released into water, cyclopentane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Mixed populations of microorganisms from groundwater contaminated with gasoline did not biodegrade cyclopentane, suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmentasl fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 52 minutes and 3 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 44 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to cyclopentane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where cyclopentane is produced or used. General population exposure may occur due to its presence in gasoline. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to cyclopentane via inhalation of ambient air. Cyclopentane is a widely occurring atmospheric pollutant. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that cyclopentane is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 52 minutes(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 3 days(SRC). Cyclopentane's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of cyclopentane from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",
