For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Oxygen molecules adjust hypoxic ventilatory drive by acting on chemoreceptors on carotid bodies that sequentially relay sensory information to the higher processing centers in brainstem. It also attenuates hypoxia-induced mitochondrial depolarization that generates reactive oxygen species and/or apoptosis. Studies investigating on hyperbaric oxygen therapy has shown that oxygen supplementation can induce neural stem cell proliferation in neonatal rats thus promoting neurological regeneration after injuries.  CD34+, CD45-dim leukocytes are also potential targets for hyperbaric oxygen therapy benefit as their mobilization was increased in vitro which could facilitate the acceleration of recovery at peripheral sites.",

A possible role for toxic oxygen metabolites was evaluated, employing a set-up of blood-perfused isolated rat lungs. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction reflected as pulmonary arterial pressor responses, was evoked by alternately challenging the airways with a hypoxic- and a normoxic gas mixture, resulting in gradually increasing responses until a maximum was obtained. In a sequence of responses (mean +/- s.e. mean) increasing from 2.5 +/ - 0.2 kPa to 3.2 +/ - 0.1 kPa, administration to the perfusate of the inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, allopurinol reduced the subsequent response to 2.5 +/- 0.2 kPa (P < 0.001). By contrast, allopurinol did not affect vasoconstriction induced by serotonin or bradykinin. In control experiments responses continued to increase after administration of hypoxanthine (substrate of xanthine oxidase). Neither pretreatment with daily injections of the antioxidant vitamin E for 3 days in advance, nor addition to the perfusate of the scavenger enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase, or dimethylsulfoxide had any impact on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction; the subsequent responses rose at the same rate and in the same way as before. Thus, the present study has shown that allopurinol inhibition of xanthine oxidase depresses hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. This could be due either to reduced production of toxic oxygen metabolites or to accumulation of purine metabolites. The absence of inhibitory effects of quenchers of toxic oxygen metabolites refutes a role for these metabolites in the elicitation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. More likely, allopurinol inhibits hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction by interfering with the purine metabolism.",

Oxygen-induced lung injury may result from an overproduction of oxygen metabolites normally scavenged by antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase and reduced glutathione. Therefore, resistance of type II cells to hyperoxia may be linked to high antioxidant activities. To test this hypothesis /the authors/ compared in vitro the effects of a 24 hr exposure period to 95% O2 on cultured type II cells, lung fibroblasts and alveolar macrophages isolated from rats. We show that type II cells, when compared with other cell types, are highly sensitive to hyperoxia as shown by increased lactate dehydrogenase release, decreased deoxyribose nucleic acid and protein content of Petri dishes and decreased thymidine incorporation into DNA. Synthesis of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine was also significantly reduced. Antioxidant enzyme activities as well as glutathione content were not higher in type II cells than in other cell types. However, hyperoxia results in a decreased superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione content in type II cells which was not observed in fibroblasts. /It was concluded/ that adaptative changes in superoxide dismutase and glutathione metabolism could be important defense mechanisms in cells exposed to hyperoxia.",

If O2 is given at high enough concentrations for long enough times, the body's protective mechanisms are overwhelmed, leading to cellular injury and, with continued exposure, even death. In the course of O2 metabolism, several toxic substances are generated, including superoxide anion (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (OH-), lipid peroxides, and others. Without the availability of several enzymes that destroy these toxic intermediary compounds, cell death quickly occurs. The protective enzymes include superoxide dismutases (SODs), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GP). Glutathione reductase (GR) participates by re-forming glutathione, which is preferentially oxidized, thereby sparing sulfhydryl-bearing proteins and cell wall constituents. Other contributors to the control of oxidant toxicity include vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), vitamin A, and selenium, a cofactor for GP. Normally, a balance exists between the production of toxic oxidants and their destruction by antioxidant mechanisms. Some individuals may lack the ability to produce sufficient antioxidants and suffer a slow progressive tissue deterioration as a result.",

Type II cells are less susceptible to toxic injury, can proliferate rapidly, and can be transformed into type I cells. Toxic injuries that affect only type I cells can be repaired by this proliferative process. To the extent that type II cells are also injured, the effects are more severe and may lead to permanent changes. Other types of cells in the lung are also affected, especially the capillary endothelial cells, leading to leakage of blood plasma into the interstitial tissue between the alveoli, and ultimately into the alveoli. Blood cells in the capillaries may also form a clot or may leak into alveolar spaces (hemorrhage). Other cells in the interstitium, such as fibroblasts, are damaged. An inflammatory response, with infiltration of white blood cells, proliferation of fibroblasts, and subsequent fibrosis may follow."

Other gases in air also dissolve into the membrane and diffuse along with oxygen; the most important of these is nitrogen. ...

Do not direct water at source of leak or safety devices; icing may occur. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. For massive fire, use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2016)",

For small spills, or after leak or flow of liq oxygen has been stopped, use enough water to put out fire quickly. When fire involves liq oxygen and liq fuels, control it as follows: (a) When liq oxygen leaks or flows into large quantities of fuel, shut off flow of liq oxygen, and put remaining fuel fire out with extinguishing agents suitable for use on class B fires. When fuel leaks or flows into large quantities of liq oxygen, shut off flow of fuel. (b) When fuel and liq oxygen are mixed or mixing but are not yet burning, isolate area from sources of ignition and get out quickly, allowing oxygen to evaporate. When large pools of water-soluble fuel are present, use water to dilute fuel and reduce intensity of fire. This method cannot be used with fuels which do not mix with water. Appropriate extinguishing agents may be used to put out fuel fires after the oxygen has evaporated.",

This can deform the gasket, increasing the likelihood that oxygen will leak around the seal and ignite.  The following general safety precautions should also be taken to avoid explosions, tank ruptures and fires from oxygen regulators.  Always \"crack\" cylinder valves (open the valve just enough to allow gas to escape for a very short time) before attaching regulators in order to expel foreign matter from the outlet port of the valve. Always follow the regulator manufacturer's instructions for attaching the regulator to an oxygen cylinder. Always use the sealing gasket specified by the regulator manufacturer. Always inspect the regulator and CGA 870 seal before attaching it to the valve to ensure that the regulator is equipped with only one clean, sealing- type washer (reusable metal-bound rubber seal) or a new crush-type gasket (single use, not reusable, typically Nylon) that is in good condition. Always be certain the valve, regulator and gasket are free from oil or grease. Oil or grease contamination is widely known to contribute to ignition in oxygen systems.  Tighten the T-handle firmly by hand, but do not use wrenches or other hand tools that may over-torque the handle. Open the post valve slowly. If gas escapes at the juncture of the regulator and valve, quickly close the valve. Verify the regulator is properly attached and the gasket is properly placed and in good condition. If you have any questions or concerns contact your supplier.",

Do not touch or walk through spilled material. Stop leak if you can do it without risk. If possible, turn leaking containers so that gas escapes rather than liquid. Do not direct water at spill or source of leak. Use water spray to reduce vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. Avoid allowing water runoff to contact spilled material. Prevent entry into waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas. Allow substance to evaporate. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. CAUTION: When in contact with refrigerated/cryogenic liquids, many materials become brittle and are likely to break without warning. (ERG, 2016)",

Ventilate closed spaces before entering.  /Oxygen; Oxygen, compressed; Oxygen, refrigerated liquid (cryogenic liquid)/",

Some of the incidents occurred during emergency medical use or during routine equipment checks. FDA and NIOSH believe that improper use of gaskets/washers in these regulators was a major factor in both the ignition and severity of the fires, although there are likely other contributing factors.  Two types of washers, referred to as CGA 870 seals, are commonly used to create the seal at the cylinder valve / regulator interface: The type recommended by many regulator manufacturers is a metal-bound elastomeric sealing washer that is designed for multiple use applications. The other common type, often supplied free-of-charge with refilled oxygen cylinders, is a plastic (usually Nylon) crush gasket suitable for single use applications.  When used more than once, the Nylon  crush gaskets require higher torque than the elastomeric sealing washers in order to seal the cylinder valve / regulator interface, and if they are used again, they require more torque with each successive use. The cylinder valve / regulator connection is designed to be hand-tightened. If the crush gaskets are re-used, the need for increased torque may require using a wrench or other hand tool, which can deform the crush gasket and damage the cylinder valve and regulator. This can result in leakage of oxygen past the cylinder valve seat and across the nylon crush gasket. According to a forensic analysis supported by FDA and NIOSH, \"flow friction\" caused by this leakage of compressed oxygen across the surface of the crush gasket may produce enough thermal energy to spontaneously ignite the nylon gasket material. ...",

Carefully maintained, anesthetized, intubated, and mechanically ventilated baboons /were exposed/ for 11 days to 40% O2, 80% O2, 100% O2 ... or 80% O2 followed by inoculation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. The groups exposed to 100% O2 or 80% O2 plus bacterial inoculation showed mixed exudative-reparative diffuse alveolar lesions, altered morphology of type II cells, increased numbers of type II cells and interstitial cells, and decreased numbers of type I and endothelial cells. The animals exposed to 40% O2 or 80% O2 showed increased numbers of alveolar macrophages and focal widening of alveolar walls. The most striking finding was that 80% O2 plus infection caused responses as severe as 100% O2. It was suggested that the combination with infection reflects the evolution of adult respiratory distress syndrome that occurs in some human patients in intensive medical care units (and other situations involving lung injury)."

This increase in pressure, often associated with diving, is opposite of the decrease in atmospheric pressure associated with aviation and mountain climbing (hypobaric).

Increased O2 pressures result in hyperoxygenation of the blood (increased dissolved O2) and allows for improved O2 delivery to tissues. Hyperbaric O2 has a number of important uses in medicine. However, the toxicity of increased O2 pressures are also evident in human and animal studies."

Rates of development of effects of pulmonary oxygen toxicity were monitored during oxygen exposure at 2.5, 2.0, and 1.5 atmospheres absolute with repeated flow-volume loops, spirometry, and symptom assessment. Additional pulmonary measurements before and after exposure included lung compliance, airway resistance, density dependence of flow, nitrogen closing volumes, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, and alveolar-arterial oxygen differences. Of these measurements only airway resistance and closing volumes were not significantly affected at any pressure, but patterns and magnitudes of effects varied at different pressures. Overall, the data indicate that continuous oxygen exposure at 3.0 to 1.5 atmospheres absolute affects pulmonary mechanical function earlier and more prominently than carbon monoxide diffusing capacity. Recovery of lung mechanical function usually occurred within 12-24 hr after exposure, but required more than 24 hr in some individuals. No individual measure of pulmonary function was found to be uniquely satisfactory for monitoring rates of development or reversal of pulmonary oxygen poisoning. The existence of multiple pulmonary effects of oxygen toxicity and the complexity of their interactions require selective applications of individual toxicity indices to specific conditions of exposure and recovery.",

Pups were then euthanized and 100 uL of blood was collected (cardiac puncture) for differential white blood cells analysis (n=12 per group). The lungs, a piece of distal ileum, and the left kidney were removed for histologic evaluation. Both NH and weaning /(return to air breathing)/ generated significant increases in blood neutrophil count, whereas lymphocyte population was significantly increased only after weaning (P<0.05; analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). Normobaric hyperoxia created mild increases in the renal tubular necrosis, dilation, regeneration, and interstitial inflammation. A significant increase in the intestinal serosal and submucosal vasodialation and vascularization occurred 1 day after weaning from 4 days of NH (P<0.001)."

Sixty-five hr of oxygen exposure in newborn rabbits produced no evidence of lung injury on light microscopy, 97% of bronchoalveolar lavage white cells were alveolar macrophages and bronchoalveolar lavage protein was low. No differences were found in the percentage of alveolar macrophages, and the proportion of PMN was low in both hyperoxic (n=9) and normoxic (n=7) newborn groups. Mortality was comparable, 14% and 11% in normoxic and hyperoxic newborn groups, respectively. An equal period of oxygen exposure produced significant lung injury in adult rabbits, and a mortality of 27% (not significant). Adults appeared dyspneic and frequently had grossly visible subpleural hemorrhages. Microscopic analysis revealed an intense inflammatory cell infiltrate, an exudate in the air spaces and areas of intra-alveolar hemorrhage. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from oxygen injured adults contained a 17-fold greater percentage of PMN and 16-fold higher protein than oxygen exposed newborns. Newborns under normoxic conditions had very high levels of 6-keto-PGF1a and low quantities of TXB2. Hyperoxic newborns had lower 6-keto-PGF1a and significantly higher TXB2. Hyperoxic adults had significantly lower 6-keto-PGF1a, and significantly higher LTB4 and LTC4 in bronchoalveolar lavage compared to hyperoxic newborns. Leukotriene D4 values, although 25% higher on average in the adult rabbits, were not statistically different.",
