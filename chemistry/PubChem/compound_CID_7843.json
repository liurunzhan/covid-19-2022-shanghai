Cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone were formed from cyclohexane and 1-, 2-, and 3-hexanol and 2-hexanone from n-hexane as predicted. Secondary alcohols are found for the other compounds studied, except for propene and isobutane, together with 2-propanone and 2-butanone from propane and n-butane, respectively. Samples from three individuals who died following LPG abuse contained a range of putative n-butane metabolites: n-butanol, 2-butanol, 2,3-butanediol, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, and 2,3-butanedione. To /the authors/ knowledge, the last three compounds have not been proposed as metabolites of n-butane in man.

This report covers two cases of sudden death due to the sniffing of a cigarette lighter refill containing butane. Autopsy was followed by toxicological, pathohistological and immunohistochemical analysis. Butane gas was confirmed in samples of blood, urine, brain and lungs... Histology showed almost identical changes in the lungs and heart in both cases. The morphology of heart damage on standard H/E stains was of special interest because it displayed all the characteristics of chronic and acute myocardial hypoxia found in the absence of atherosclerotic heart disease. In order to confirm early cardiac death caused by asphyxia due to butane inhalation a panel of immunohistochemical agents was used...",

CAUTION: Hydrogen (UN1049), Deuterium (UN1957), Hydrogen, refrigerated liquid (UN1966) and Methane (UN1971) are lighter than air and will rise. Hydrogen and Deuterium fires are difficult to detect since they burn with an invisible flame. Use an alternate method of detection (thermal camera, broom handle, etc.) Vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back. Cylinders exposed to fire may vent and release flammable gas through pressure relief devices. Containers may explode when heated. Ruptured cylinders may rocket. (ERG, 2016)",

International Drug Control Programme, indicating its potential to cause narcosis in workers. [Reference #1] In confined space spill, may displace air and act as simple asphyxiant; Inhalation of high concentrations may cause CNS effects; [ICSC]",

AEGLs are used by emergency responders when dealing with chemical spills or other catastrophic exposures.  AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

If symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop, immediately transport the victim to a hospital.  SKIN: CAUTION: Exposure of skin to compressed gases may result in freezing of the skin. Treatment for frostbite may be necessary. Remove the victim from the source of contamination. IMMEDIATELY wash affected areas gently with COLD water (and soap, if necessary) while removing and isolating all contaminated clothing. Dry carefully with clean, soft towels. If symptoms such as inflammation or irritation develop, IMMEDIATELY call a physician or go to a hospital for treatment.  INHALATION: IMMEDIATELY leave the contaminated area; take deep breaths of fresh air. If symptoms (such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or burning in the mouth, throat, or chest) develop, call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital. Provide proper respiratory protection to rescuers entering an unknown atmosphere. Whenever possible, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) should be used; if not available, use a level of protection greater than or equal to that advised under Protective Clothing.  INGESTION: This compound is a gas, therefore inhalation is the first route of exposure. (NTP, 1992)",

Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. Do not direct water at source of leak or safety devices; icing may occur. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire.

Do not direct water at spill or source of leak. Prevent spreading of vapors through sewers, ventilation systems and confined areas. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. CAUTION: When in contact with refrigerated/cryogenic liquids, many materials become brittle and are likely to break without warning. (ERG, 2016)",

It occurs as a component in natural gas from which it is refined. n-Butane is used as fuel, refrigerant and aerosol propellant. The acute toxicity of n-butane has been studied after inhalation exposure in experimental animals. LC50 (4h) was 658 mg/l in rats and LC50 (2h) was 680 mg/l in mice. In dogs, lethal concentrations ranged from 474 to 592 mg/l. A concentration of 308 mg/l caused light anesthesia in mice within 25 minutes, and an exposure to 521 mg/l had similar effect within one minute. n-Butane ... sensitiz/ed/ the myocardium to epinephrine-induced cardiac arrhythmias in dogs after inhalation. No reports on acute toxicity of n-butane in experimental animals by other administration routes were located in the available literature. In a 21-day inhalation toxicity study of a mixture of n-butane, isobutane, n-penta and isopentane, containing 25% of each, the absence of toxicity was evident up to 11.8 mg/l which was the highest concentration tested. The study was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats which were exposed 6 hours per day over three weeks for a total of 15 exposures. No long-term studies using pure n-butane were located in the available literature. No mutagenic activity was observed in several tests in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 1535, TA 1537, TA 1538, TA 98 and TA 100 with or without the addition of an exogenous metabolism system. No studies on carcinogenicity, reproduction toxicity and teratogenicity, immunotoxicity or allergy were located in the available literature. Several reports on human exposure to n-butane were available. The increasing abuse of volatile substances, n-butane being among them, increases the risk of sudden death in connection to inhalation of the gas. The range of concentrations that may lead to \"high\" feelings or to death has been noted to be very narrow. The use of a oven cleaner containing n-butane as propellant has caused transient myoclonus in one patient. No other physical abnormalities were noted. An aerosol spray which contained n-butane as propellant, was reported to cause deep frostbite symptoms ir the skin when sprayed directly on it. Because of the anesthetic effect of n-butane, truck drivers and terminal operators from different loading facilities and service stations were examined for exposure gasoline vapours containing 90 to 92 percent n-butane, isobutane, n-pentane and isopentane. Exposures to the gasoline vapor were substantially lower than the established ACGIH threshold values (300 ppm or 0.89 mg/l for gasoline, and 800 ppm or 1.9 mg/l for n-butane). Occupational exposure of 53 male refinery workers for an average of 11 years to n-butane (concentration varied from 0.0004 mg/l to 0.0178 mg/l) did not cause any clinical symptoms in the workers. ... In conclusion, exposure to low concentrations of n-butane has not been reported to cause adverse effects in humans. It is anesthetic to both humans and experimental animals. Sudden death may occur when n-butane is inhaled at high concentrations. The safety margin between anesthetic and lethal concentrations appears to be very narrow. Chronic exposure to n-butane has been reported to cause some symptoms in the central nervous system. Critical effects might be lethality when inhaled in high doses, and effects on the central nervous system in chronically exposed individuals.",

The test compound was injected directly into sealed desiccator chambers. Cell cultures (3/concentration level) were tested at 1000, 5000, 10000, 20000 ppm. Three cultures served as vehicle/negative controls (air-injected), and 3 cultures were exposed to 2-acetylaminofluorene (0.2 mcg/ml) as positive controls. An additional 3 cultures served as system controls: no injections were made into the chamber. The cultures were exposed to the test compound and 3H-thymidine for 18-20 hours. Slides were prepared and dipped in autoradiographic emulsion and were subsequently developed, stained, and coverslipped. The average net nuclear grain count per slide was calculated and the mean net nuclear grain count was determined for each exposure concentration. The positive and negative controls gave expected results for unscheduled DNA synthesis. A weak positive response was observed at 20000 ppm butadiene feedstock when compared to the negative control.

All groups were exposed for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week. Half the males from each were randomly selected for sacrifice and necropsy after the twentieth exposure; the remaining animals were necropsied after 65 exposures. All animals survived to scheduled sacrifice. Male rats (3/10) exposed to 4500 ppm and male (2/10) and female (1/10) rats exposed to 1000 ppm exhibited hunched posture and/or lethargy which persisted 1 to 3 days following week 6. Both males and females exposed to the hydrocarbon mixtures showed crusted eyes and swollen eyelids, the highest incidence was observed in females receiving 4500 ppm. Body weights were significantly decreased in males and females at both exposure levels compared to controls by weeks 3 and 4. Female body weights remained depressed throughout the course of the study, while males seemed to recover during week 11. There was no apparent dose-relationship, however. Liver and kidney weights from all treated rats were comparable to those of the controls at both 4 and 13 weeks. Gross lesions observed during necropsy were considered unrelated to treatment.",

The information may include data from toxicity tests performed on aquatic and/or terrestrial organisms, where available (e.g., acute or chronic aquatic toxicity data for fish, algae, and crustaceans; toxicity data on birds, bees, and plants).  This section also includes information on whether there is a potential for the chemical to persist or degrade in the environment either through biodegradation or other processes (such as oxidation or hydrolysis) as well as the concentration or amount of the chemical found in the environment (e.g., in plants, animals as well as in the atmosphere or water).",

                          "String": "n-Butane's production and use in many products associated with the petroleum and natural gas industries may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. The combustion of gasoline is a major mechanism for the release of n-butane into the atmosphere. Waste incinerators, hazardous waste disposal sites, and landfills also release n-butane into the environment. n-Butane occurs as a highly-volatile constituent in the paraffin fraction of crude oil, in natural gas, liquefied natural gas and substitute natural gas. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1820 mm Hg at 25 Â°C indicates n-butane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase n-butane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.3 days. Data also suggest that nighttime reactions with radical species and nitrogen oxides may contribute to the atmospheric transformation of n-butane. n-Butane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, n-butane is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 40. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.95 atm-cu m/mole. n-Butane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A biodegradation rate of 1.8 mg C/day/kg dry soil suggests that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, n-butane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 50 minutes and 3 days, respectively. While volatilization is expected to be the dominant fate process in both soil and water, n-butane is also susceptible to biodegradation processes. Complete biodegradation was reported in 34 days using an activated sludge inoculum, suggesting biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water. An estimated BCF of 40 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to n-butane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-butane, or petroleum and natural gas containing n-butane, is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that n-butane is a widely occurring atmospheric pollutant. The most likely pathway by which the general population may be exposed to n-butane is via inhalation of ambient air; in addition, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound in liquids such as crude oil and gasoline and other liquid products containing n-butane may result in exposure, although these pathways are considered minor when compared to inhalation.

While volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be the predominant fate process in water, this compound is also susceptible to biodegradation(SRC). Complete biodegradation was reported in 34 days using an activated sludge inoculum(9), suggesting biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Gas-phase n-butane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.3 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.54X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 deg(3). Experimental data showed that 7.7% of the n-butane fraction in a dark chamber reacted with nitrogen oxide to form the corresponding alkyl nitrate(4,5), suggesting nighttime reactions with radical species and nitrogen oxides may contribute to the atmospheric transformation of n-butane(SRC). Based on data for iso-octane and n-hexane(6), n-butane is not expected to absorb UV light at wavelengths  >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Among the last compounds to be degraded was butane, for which a degradation half-life was calculated as 15 days(1). Within 24 hrs, n-butane was oxidized to its corresponding methyl ketone, 2-butanone(2,3), and the corresponding alcohol, 2-butanol(3,4), by cell suspensions of over 20 methyltrophic organisms isolated from lake water and soil samples(1-3). After 192 hrs, the concentration of n-butane contained in gasoline was reduced from 0.63 to 0.37 uL/L for both a sterile control and a mixed culture sample collected from ground water contaminated with gasoline; these data indicate that n-butane was not biodegraded over the study period(5). The biodegradation of n-butane in a Columbia River soil was measured over 50 days; a degradation rate of 1.8 mgC/day/kg dry soil was reported without the addition of nitrogen(6). When nitrogen at 0.15 mg per bottle was added, the degradation rate increased to 11.4 mg C/day/kg dry soil(6). 100% of the initially added n-butane (32.9 mg/L) was biodegraded over 34 days in a screening study using an activated sludge inoculum(7).",

The terminal methyl group is enzymatically oxidized by incorporation of molecular oxygen by a monooxygenase producing a primary alcohol with further oxidation to an acid group, although involvement of a dioxygenase is also postulated. Once the fatty acid is produced, it is degraded into 2-carbon units via the beta-oxidation pathway. ... Another pathway for n-alkane degradation that is encountered less often is the oxidation of both terminal carbons to form a dioic acid with subsequent beta-oxidation. Subterminal oxidation of the 2-carbon atom is seen mainly in C3-C6 alkanes. ... A dehydrogenation of the n-alkane may also occur yielding an alkene which is then converted to an alcohol, although there is little evidence for this theory. Some microorganisms have been shown to have both terminal and subterminal oxidation, each having very different rates of activity. /In a study comparing/ ... growth on long and short chain alkanes by some bacteria ... the initial oxygenase had a broad specificity and would oxidize C1-C8 alkanes ... /but/ cells grown on C4-C8 alkanes did not oxidize the shorter chain alkanes to a significant extent. ... /n-Alkanes/",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 6.3 days(SRC) at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). Experimental data showed that 7.7% of the n-butane fraction in a dark chamber reacted with nitrogen oxide to form the corresponding alkyl nitrate(3,4); this suggests that nighttime reactions with radical species and nitrogen oxides may contribute to the atmospheric transformation of n-butane. The rate constant for the gas-phase reaction of n-butane with photochemically-produced nitrate radicals is 4.59X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 Â°C(1). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 1.9 years(SRC) at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(5). n-Butane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(6). Based on data for iso-octane and n-hexane(7), n-butane is not expected to absorb UV light at wavelengths  >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). The n-butane concentration of an air sample, initially 286 ppbC, was reduced by 14% within 6 hrs of irradiation by natural sunlight in downtown Los Angeles, CA(8).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Exposure may occur via inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-butane, or petroleum and natural gas containing n-butane, are produced or used(SRC). A 1984 study showed n-butane was emitted from gasoline exposing outside operators at the refineries to an average air concentration of 3.437 mg/cu m; n-butane was detected in 54 of 56 samples(2). Transport drivers were exposed to n-butane at atmospheric concentration of 9.701 mg/cu m and n-butane was detected in 49 of 49 samples(2). Gas station attendants were exposed to n-butane at atmospheric concentration of 21.605 mg/cu m and n-butane was detected in 49 of 49 samples(2). Attendants at a high volume service station in eastern PA were exposed to levels of n-butane ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 ppm for 18 of 18 air samples(3). Workers at separate gasoline bulk handling facilities were exposed to vapors that contained n-butane at concentration of 33.7% by weight, 21.2% by weight and 38.1% by volume(4) of total hydrocarbons. Exposures to total hydrocarbons at one of the facilities exceeded 240 ppm for 5% of the sampling time(4). n-Butane is a highly volatile compound and monitoring data indicate that it is a widely occurring atmospheric pollutant(SRC). These data indicate that the general population may be exposed to n-butane via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound in liquids such as crude oil and gasoline and other liquid products containing n-butane(SRC).",
