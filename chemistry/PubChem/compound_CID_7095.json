When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time.

                          "String": "IDENTIFICATION: Biphenyl is an aromatic hydrocarbon and it is a colorless solid at room temperature. It is used as an intermediate in the production of a variety of compounds such as: emulsifiers, optical brighteners, crop protection products and plastics, as a dyestuff carrier in textiles and copying paper, as a solvent in pharmaceutical production and in the preservation of citrus fruits. Biphenyl occurs naturally in coal tar, crude oil and natural gas. HUMAN EXPOSURE: Exposure to high levels of biphenyl vapors or dusts in the workplace results in the irritation of the eyes and inflammation of the respiratory tract. Long-term exposure for several years to high level biphenyl concentrations caused damage to the liver and persistent neuronal changes. Direct skin contact may have played a part, in addition to uptake through the respiratory tract. ANIMAL/PLANT STUDIES: Biphenyl was well absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract. In those species examined, the metabolites of biphenyl, mainly 4-hydroxybiphenyl, are excreted rapidly and almost exclusively in the urine. Acute oral toxicity is moderate. It is non-irritating to the skin and only slightly irritating to the eyes. There is no evidence of dermal sensitization. Subchronic exposure by inhalation caused bronchopulmonary changes, whereas long term toxicity studies following inhalation were not identified in literature. In toxicological studies in which rodents have been administered diets containing biphenyl for various periods of time, effects on the urinary system have often been reported. A marked increase of formation of calculi, hyperplasia and desquamation effects have been observed in the urinary tract of male rats administered diets containing biphenyl. An increase in the occurrence of calculi and squamous metaplasia within the urinary bladder of female rats has also been observed, but at lower incidence than males. In male mice fed a diet containing biphenyl developed simple hyperplasia and popular or nodular dysplasia of the urinary bladder. Effects on blood chemistry and hematological parameters have also been observed in animals administered biphenyl orally; these effects occur in male and female rats and mice at intakes over those associated with the development of effects in the urinary bladder of male rats administered biphenyl. For non-neoplastic effects the lowest observed level (LOEL) was based on the development of alterations in hematological parameters (i.e. decreased hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit) in rats fed diets containing biphenyl. In vitro studies with bacteria provided no evidence of mutagenic potential for biphenyl with Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7, gene mutation and mitotic recombination were observed with or without metabolic activation. However, genetic toxicology testing in mammalian cells produced positive results in the presence of metabolic activation and negative results in the absence of metabolic activation. In female mice there were slight increased incidences of benign and malignant liver tumors in animals receiving biphenyl in the diet for 2 yr. An increased incidence of bladder tumors was observed in male rats, but not in female rats or male or female mice, administered high levels of biphenyl. However, observations of an increased incidence of histopathological effects and the formation of calculi within the urinary bladder, in absence of bladder tumors in female rats administered biphenyl for 2 yr,  lack of data identifying a direct association between calculi formation, regenerative hyperplasia of the urothelium, and the development of bladder tumors within individual male animals and (3) the potential genotoxicity of biphenyl could suggest that the development of bladder tumors in the male rats may not have been entirely due to the effects associated with the formation of calculi within the urinary bladder. This observation and the hepatocarcinogenicity in female mice raises some concerns with respect to the carcinogenicity of biphenyl. Available data on the reproductive toxicity of biphenyl are limited. Results from a 3 generation study in rats, in which adverse effects such as decreased fertility, litter size, growth rate were noted, there was no evidence that biphenyl induced reproductive or developmental effects. Biphenyl has weak bactericidal and fungistatic properties. In toxicity studies on organisms of four trophic levels, the lowest no observed effect concentration (NOEC) was reported for the most sensitive species, Daphnia magna.",

Biphenyl impregnated, fruit wrapping paper had been produced under extremely poor hygienic conditions; depending on the operation, average biphenyl concentration in air varied from 4.4 to 128 mg/cu m in 1959 and from 0.6 to 123 mg/cu m in 1970. Such exposures had led to the poisoning of eight other workers. The clinical picture of biphenyl poisoning was characterized by central and peripheral nerve damage and liver injury. The cause of death was acute yellow atrophy of the liver. Although the prognosis in cases of biphenyl poisoning is as yet unknown, deterioration of the central and peripheral nervous functions was seen in some patients; in others, slight improvement was noted. A detailed description of the neurological findings of the 24 exposed workers in this biphenyl impregnated paper plant has since been reported. Ten showed electroencephalographic abnormalities of a generally diffuse nature, which persisted 1 and 2 years later. Nine workers had electromyographic abnormalities, of which seven showed fibrillation of some muscles, and one showed a long rhythmic series of fasciculation resembling that in infantile spinal muscular atrophy. These electroneuromyographic abnormalities also persisted on reexamination. The recommendation implied was that electrophysiologic methods be applied for detection of early changes from biphenyl exposure.",

Biphenyl is synthesized in certain plants and in algae. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 8.93X10-3 mm Hg at 25 °C indicates biphenyl will exist as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase biphenyl will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. Biphenyl has been found partly in the particle-sorbed phase in the atmosphere; therefore, particulate-phase biphenyl may be physically removed from the air by dry deposition. As biphenyl absorbs very little light at wavelengths above 290 nm, direct photolysis in air is not expected to be an important process. If released to soil, biphenyl is expected to have low to slight mobility based upon Koc values of 870 to 3,300. Test results indicate that biodegradation in soil is variable with 86% mineralized to carbon dioxide in 98 days using a Flanagan silt loam soil, and in an Altamont soil, 81% of biphenyl initially applied mineralized after 24 days. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.08X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, biphenyl is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the measured Kocs. Biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process under aerobic conditions, as indicated by a reported half-life of 2-3 days in a river die-away test. Acclimation may increase biodegradation rates. Biphenyl may be resistant to biodegradation under anaerobic conditions. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hrs and 6 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 41 days if adsorption is considered. BCF values from 280 to 4,500 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to biphenyl may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where biphenyl is produced or used. The most likely pathway by which the general public is exposed to biphenyl is by inhalation due to the release of this substance from combustion of natural products, fuel, and refuse, and cigarette smoke. Monitoring data also indicate that the general population may be exposed to biphenyl via ingestion of food and drinking water, although these pathways are considered minor when compared to inhalation.

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hrs and 6 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 41 days if adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), a BCF range of 280-4,500(7-10) suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC). Biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process under aerobic conditions, as indicated by a reported half-life of 2-3 days in a river die-away test(11); however, the compound may be resistant to biodegradation under anaerobic conditions(12).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that biphenyl is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 4 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 6 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 41 days if adsorption is considered(3). Biphenyl's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The rate of volatilization from moist soil was found to be rapid(4). A desorption rate constant (attributed to volatilization) of 3.2X10-3/hr (half-life = 9 days) was measured using PCB-contaminated, aged sediments from the Rhine River, Germany(5). However, the importance of volatilization should decrease as the soil depth increases(5). Biphenyl is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure of 8.93X10-3 mm Hg(6).",

Burning either polystyrene, PVC, polyethylene, polypropylene and PMMA in a horizontal furnace at 750 °C with 1.1 second postflame residence time resulted in the release of biphenyl at unreported concns(4). During waste gasification processes the crude and purified gas contained biphenyl at 10,000-66,000 and 17,000-43,000 g/normalized cu m, respectively; flue gas samples contained biphenyl at 1000-2300 g/normalized cu m(5). Biphenyl was detected at 71, 5, 44, and 18 ng/normalized cu m in flue gas following fluid bed combustion of four coal species from South Africa, Poland, Spisbergen and the Ruhr area (Germany), respectively(6). Effluent from two coke plants in Alabama contained biphenyl at average concns of 0.04 and 0.56 ug/L(7).",

Occupational exposure to biphenyl may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where biphenyl is produced or used(SRC). Extensive workplace air monitoring data(2-5) and monitoring data in non-working place indoor and personal air samples(5,6) indicate inhalation is probably the most important route of exposure, due to the release of this substance from combustion of natural products, fuel, and refuse, and cigarette smoke. Monitoring data also indicate that the general population may be exposed to biphenyl via ingestion of food and drinking water, although these pathways are considered minor when compared to inhalation(SRC).",
