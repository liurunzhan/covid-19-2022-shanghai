When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

However, even in health low levels of lipid peroxidation can be detected by measuring the pulmonary excretion of pentane. Lipid peroxidation has been postulated to be one of the causes of the ageing process. In order to test whether pentane excretion is related to age, we measured breath pentane in 47 healthy subjects (ages 21-79). We also measured serum levels of the antioxidants tocopherol, retinol, lycopene, beta carotene, ascorbate and zinc. We found that pentane excretion significantly (P < 0.05, r = 0.32) increased with age. Of the six antioxidants measured, only lycopene decreased significantly (P < 0.05, r = -0.47) with age, however, this decline did not statistically correlate with pentane excretion. The remaining five antioxidants either remained stable or increased over the age range studied. We conclude that lipid peroxidation, as assessed by pentane excretion, increases with advancing age but that this increase is independent of dietary antioxidant levels. /SRP: Pentane is formed from the lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids/",

Flush victim's eyes with water or normal saline solution for 20 to 30 minutes while simultaneously calling a hospital or poison control center. Do not put any ointments, oils, or medication in the victim's eyes without specific instructions from a physician. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim after flushing eyes to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop.  SKIN: IMMEDIATELY flood affected skin with water while removing and isolating all contaminated clothing. Gently wash all affected skin areas thoroughly with soap and water. If symptoms such as redness or irritation develop, IMMEDIATELY call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital for treatment.  INHALATION: IMMEDIATELY leave the contaminated area; take deep breaths of fresh air. If symptoms (such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or burning in the mouth, throat, or chest) develop, call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital. Provide proper respiratory protection to rescuers entering an unknown atmosphere. Whenever possible, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) should be used; if not available, use a level of protection greater than or equal to that advised under Protective Clothing.  INGESTION: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. Volatile chemicals have a high risk of being aspirated into the victim's lungs during vomiting which increases the medical problems. If the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give 1 or 2 glasses of water to dilute the chemical and IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. (NTP, 1992)",

CAUTION: For mixtures containing alcohol or polar solvent, alcohol-resistant foam may be more effective.  SMALL FIRE: Dry chemical, CO2, water spray or regular foam.  LARGE FIRE: Water spray, fog or regular foam. Do not use straight streams. Move containers from fire area if you can do it without risk.  FIRE INVOLVING TANKS OR CAR/TRAILER LOADS: Fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles. Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. For massive fire, use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2016)",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

All groups were exposed for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week. Half the males from each were randomly selected for sacrifice and necropsy after the twentieth exposure; the remaining animals were necropsied after 65 exposures. All animals survived to scheduled sacrifice. Male rats (3/10) exposed to 4500 ppm and male (2/10) and female (1/10) rats exposed to 1000 ppm exhibited hunched posture and/or lethargy which persisted 1 to 3 days following week 6. Both males and females exposed to the hydrocarbon mixtures showed crusted eyes and swollen eyelids, the highest incidence was observed in females receiving 4500 ppm. Body weights were significantly decreased in males and females at both exposure levels compared to controls by weeks 3 and 4. Female body weights remained depressed throughout the course of the study, while males seemed to recover during week 11. There was no apparent dose-relationship, however. Liver and kidney weights from all treated rats were comparable to those of the controls at both 4 and 13 weeks. Gross lesions observed during necropsy were considered unrelated to treatment.",

The vast majority of n-pentane is released to the environment through the manufacture, use, and disposal of many products associated with the petroleum industry and the combustion of gasoline. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 514 mm Hg at 25 °C indicates n-pentane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase n-pentane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3 days. n-Pentane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, n-pentane is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 72. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.25 atm-cu m/mole. n-Pentane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Screening studies suggest that n-pentane will undergo biodegradation in soil and water surfaces, but volatilization is expected to be the predominant fate process in the environment. If released into water, n-pentane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.5 hrs and 3.4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 80 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to n-pentane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-pentane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to n-pentane via inhalation of ambient air, particularly at urban areas with heavy vehicular traffic or gasoline filling stations.

The terminal methyl group is enzymatically oxidized by incorporation of molecular oxygen by a monooxygenase producing a primary alcohol with further oxidation to an acid group, although involvement of a dioxygenase is also postulated. Once the fatty acid is produced, it is degraded into 2-carbon units via the beta-oxidation pathway. ... Another pathway for n-alkane degradation that is encountered less often is the oxidation of both terminal carbons to form a dioic acid with subsequent beta-oxidation. Subterminal oxidation of the 2-carbon atom is seen mainly in C3-C6 alkanes. ... A dehydrogenation of the n-alkane may also occur yielding an alkene which is then converted to an alcohol, although there is little evidence for this theory. Some microorganisms have been shown to have both terminal and subterminal oxidation, each having very different rates of activity. /In a study comparing/ ... growth on long and short chain alkanes by some bacteria ... the initial oxygenase had a broad specificity and would oxidize C1-C8 alkanes ... /but/ cells grown on C4-C8 alkanes did not oxidize the shorter chain alkanes to a significant extent. ... /n-Alkanes/",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Transport drivers were exposed to n-pentane at atmospheric concentration of 4.570 mg/cu m and n-pentane was detected in 48 of 49 air samples(2). Gas station attendants were exposed to n-pentane at atmospheric concentration of 5.428 mg/cu m and n-pentane was detected in 48 of 49 samples(2). Tank contractors were exposed to vapors containing n-pentane at concentration of 37.4 ppm at gasoline tank removal sites(3).
