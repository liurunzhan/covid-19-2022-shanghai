PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Cyclohexane is known to undergo oxidative metabolism to yield cyclohexanol (major metabolite), cyclohexanone, and possibly other oxidative products (1,2- or 1,4-dihydroxycyclohexane and its corresponding ketone analogs). The alcohol products can form phase 2 conjugates (sulfates and glucuronide).",

Of the dose of absorbed parent compounds, the yields of urinary CH-ol and 1,2- and 1,4-cyclohexanediol (CH-diol) were 0.5%, 23.4%, and 11.3%, respectively, after exposure to CH and 1.1%, 19.1%, and 8.4%, respectively, after exposure to CH-ol as determined by a gas chromatography method involving hydrolysis of glucuronide conjugates. The metabolic patterns of CH and CH-ol were very similar to that of cyclohexanone (CH-one) studied in the laboratory previously. For all three compounds, peak excretion of CH-ol occurred at the end of the exposure period, after which it decayed rapidly. Excretion curves of 1,2- and 1,4-CH-diol reached maximal values within 0-6 hr postexposure, with subsequent elimination half-lives being 14-18 hr.

The C2 and C3 hydrocarbons were separated on a 5 m long stainless steel column packed with silica gel. C4 to C13 hydrocarbons were separated on a 125 m long glass capillary column containing 7.5% hydrophobic silica. A stainless steel subambient hydrocarbon trap filled with untreated glass wool permitted the concn of at least 4 L of sample at 70% relative humidity. A temperature controller cooled the trap for hydrocarbon concn and thermally described the hydrocarbons for gas chromatographic analysis. This trap extends the detection limits for most hydrocarbons to 15.0 ppt carbon. Hydrocarbons collected on Tenax cartridges were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in order to provide qualitative identification for the peaks obtained from the GC analysis. /SRP: Cyclohexane qualitative, 45th peak on GC/MS in roadside sample hydrocarbons; no quantitative data./",

Flush victim's eyes with water or normal saline solution for 20 to 30 minutes while simultaneously calling a hospital or poison control center. Do not put any ointments, oils, or medication in the victim's eyes without specific instructions from a physician. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim after flushing eyes to a hospital even if no symptoms (such as redness or irritation) develop.  SKIN: IMMEDIATELY flood affected skin with water while removing and isolating all contaminated clothing. Gently wash all affected skin areas thoroughly with soap and water. If symptoms such as redness or irritation develop, IMMEDIATELY call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital for treatment.  INHALATION: IMMEDIATELY leave the contaminated area; take deep breaths of fresh air. If symptoms (such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or burning in the mouth, throat, or chest) develop, call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital. Provide proper respiratory protection to rescuers entering an unknown atmosphere. Whenever possible, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) should be used; if not available, use a level of protection greater than or equal to that advised under Protective Clothing.  INGESTION: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. Volatile chemicals have a high risk of being aspirated into the victim's lungs during vomiting which increases the medical problems. If the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give 1 or 2 glasses of water to dilute the chemical and IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. (NTP, 1992)",

Use of water spray when fighting fire may be inefficient. CAUTION: For mixtures containing alcohol or polar solvent, alcohol-resistant foam may be more effective.  SMALL FIRE: Dry chemical, CO2, water spray or regular foam.  LARGE FIRE: Water spray, fog or regular foam. Avoid aiming straight or solid streams directly onto the product. If it can be done safely, move undamaged containers away from the area around the fire.  FIRE INVOLVING TANKS OR CAR/TRAILER LOADS: Fight fire from maximum distance or use unmanned master stream devices or monitor nozzles. Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. For petroleum crude oil, do not spray water directly into a breached tank car. This can lead to a dangerous boil over. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. For massive fire, use unmanned master stream devices or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2020)",

Basis for revised IDLH: Based on health considerations and acute inhalation toxicity data in animals [Lazarew 1929; Treon et al. 1943], a value of about 3,000 ppm would have been appropriate.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

                          "String": "IDENTIFICATION AND USE: Cyclohexane is a colorless, highly flammable liquid occurring naturally in petroleum at concentrations of 0.5-1.0%.  It has a pungent petroleum-like odor and is used as an organic solvent for lacquers, resins, and synthetic rubber; paint and varnish remover; extraction of essential oils; manufacturing of solid fuel for camp stoves; in fungicidal formulations; in recrystallization of steroids; and in analytical chemistry for molecular weight determinations.  It is also a chemical intermediate in the manufacturing of adipic acid, benzene, cyclohexyl chloride, nitrocyclohexane, cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone.  Not registered for current pesticide use in the U.S., but approved pesticide uses may change periodically and so federal, state and local authorities must be consulted for currently approved uses. Studies from the exposure of the general population to cyclohexane revealed that human milk from five of eight mothers contained cyclohexane (concentrations not determined) from the mothers' exposure to environmental pollutants since they resided near chemical manufacturing plants or industrial user facilities. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY:  The available data indicate that cyclohexane can be absorbed via oral and inhalation routes but no adequate data exist via the dermal route.  Potential symptoms of overexposure to cyclohexane are irritation of eyes, skin and respiratory system; drowsiness; dermatitis; narcosis and coma although cyclohexane generally has low acute toxicity.  In humans exposed via inhalation for 4 hours to 86 or 860 mg/cu m cyclohexane, there were no significant treatment-related effects.  Occupational exposure to 5 to 211 ppm cyclohexane for a median of 1.2 years, had no adverse effects on the peripheral nervous system.  There have been no systemic poisonings reported in man.  Cyclohexane is known to undergo oxidative metabolism to yield cyclohexanol (major metabolite), cyclohexanone, and possibly other oxidative products (1,2- or 1,4-dihydroxycyclohexane and its corresponding ketone analogs).  ANIMAL STUDIES: High vapor concentrations have produced convulsions in rabbits.  Toxic oral doses in rabbits led to severe diarrhea, circulatory collapse and death, without prominent central nervous depression or anesthesia.  Autopsy revealed generalized vascular damage but no effects on blood formation. Rats and mice, were exposed to 0, 500, 2000, or 7000 ppm of cyclohexane vapor 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 14 weeks.  During exposure sessions, mice exposed to 7000 ppm exhibited clinical signs of toxicity which included hyperactivity, circling, jumping/hopping, excessive grooming, kicking of rear legs, standing on front legs, and occasional flipping behavior. In another study, male and female mice exposed to 7000 ppm had slight increases in measures of circulating erythrocyte mass (red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit) and plasma protein concentration (males only).  Male rats and male and female mice exposed to 7000 ppm had significantly increased relative liver weights, and 7000 ppm male mice also had significantly increased absolute liver weights at the end of the exposure period.  In the third study, female rats were administered cyclohexane intraperitoneally at a dose of 0.375, 0.75, or 1.5 g/kg, 5 days a week for 2 weeks.  The high dose of 1.5 g/kg of cyclohexane caused a proximal tubular dysfunction of the kidney which resulted in an increase in beta-2-microglobulin.  The increase in beta-2-microglobulin was attributed to the metabolite cyclohexanol.  When testing the effect of cyclohexane on reproduction and development, there were statistically significant reductions in mean body weight, overall mean body weight gain, and overall mean food efficiency for P1 and F1 females exposed to 7000 ppm. Adult rats exposed to 2000 ppm or 7000 ppm cyclohexane exhibited diminished response or no response to a sound stimulus while in the chambers during exposure. Mean pup weight was statistically significantly reduced from lactation day 7 throughout the remainder of the 25-day lactation period for both F1 and F2 7000 ppm litters. Cyclohexane was negative for mutagenicity at doses of 0.01, 0.033, 0.10, 0.33, 1.0, 3.3, and 10 mg/plate in as many as 5 Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA1535, TA1537, TA97, TA98, and TA100) with or without metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Cyclohexane inhibited growth of Chlorella for 11-13 days, but prolonged the exponential growth phase and increased the growth yield 2.5 fold compared with the control. Acute toxicities after 24 and 96 hr exposures to seven alicyclic hexanes including cyclohexane were determined for striped bass and one of their major food organisms, the bay shrimp, Crangon franciscorum. The 96 hr LC50 for striped bass and bay shrimp ranged from 3.2 to 9.3 uL/L and from 1.0 to 6.2 uL/L, respectively.",

Plasma extravasation used as a parameter of inflammation was measured by Evans blue and (125)I-bovine serum albumin (BSA). Total volume of plasma extravasation induced by 4 organic solvents in 240-min exposure was as follows: toluene > m-xylene > cyclohexane > acetone = 0. While hydrophobic solvents (toluene, m-xylene, cyclohexane) induced plasma extravasation, the hydrophilic solvent, acetone, did not induce plasma extravasation. It was suggested that the severity and time course of plasma extravasation depend on chemical characteristics of the organic solvents. In immunohistochemical study, substance P (SP)-immunoreactive nerve fibers (IRNF) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-IRNF were intact during 240-min exposure to acetone. In contrast, cyclohexane, toluene, and m-xylene reduced the number of SP-IRNF and CGRP-IRNF in 10 min exposure and further reduced immunoreactivity. In hairless rats treated with systemic capsaicin, the above plasma extravasation was significantly reduced, along with SP-IRNF and CGRP-IRNF; however, protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5)-IRNF was nearly intact. These results indicated that certain organic solvents induce instance of inflammation that vary widely in terms of their severity and time course, and that these differences are correlated with neuropeptides.",

A significant incr was observed in the urinary excretion of beta-2-microglobulin in cyclohexane-treated rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats repeatedly injected with 1 g/kg of cyclohexane showed a 3.2-fold incr in beta-2-microglobulin excretion. Female Sprague-Dawley rats repeatedly injected ip with cyclohexane (0.375, 0.75 or 1.5 g/kg) showed the following renal parameters, respectively: glomerular filtration rate (mL/min/g kidney), 1.48 + or - 0.052, 1.49 + or - 0.017, and 1.55 + or - 0.085; renal plasma flow (mL/min/g kidney) 2.78 + or - 0.17, 2.82 + or - 0.091, and 2.72 + or - 0.159; urine osmolality (mmol/kg) 1890 + or - 208, 1856 + or - 170, and 1283 + or - 180; kidney weight (% body wt) 0.723 + or - 0.019, 0.687 + or - 0.011, and 0.689 + or - 0.031. The increased beta-2-microglobulinuria caused by cyclohexane was both time-and dose-dependent and was not accompanied by changes in the glomerular filtration rate or renal plasma flow, but at the highest dose (1.5 /kg), the renal concentration ability was depressed.",

The weights of the body and selected tissues of the rats were monitored and standard enzyme assays were conducted for some enzymes in the serum. Results showed that rats in cyclohexane group gained 58% whereas the control group gained 46% of body weight. Liver weight (absolute and relative) of test rats were found to be significantly lower than that of control (p < .05). Enzyme activity of serum of test rats was found to be significantly higher than that of control (p < .05). Experimental evidence suggests leakage of enzymes from the liver to the serum, thus the elevated serum enzyme activity and that the contaminants may damage the liver.",

The alicyclic compounds were cyclohexane ... . Acute toxicities after 24 and 96 hr exposures to seven alicyclic hexanes were determined for striped bass and one of their major food organisms, the bay shrimp, Crangon franciscorum. The 96 hr LC50 for striped bass and bay shrimp ranged from 3.2 to 9.3 uL/L and from 1.0 to 6.2 uL/L, respectively. Slight differences were noted between the 24 and 96 hr LC50 values in all but two bioassays. Solubilities of these alicyclics in seawater and freshwater were determined since information in the literature was limited. ... Tissue analyses showed greater bioaccumulation in striped bass, which have more lipid than bay shrimp. Striped bass had up to 260 uL/kg (wet weight) of an alicyclic hexane after exposure to water concn ranging from 0.32 to 12 uL/L. Bay shrimp residues were as much as 110 uL/kg of an alicyclic hexane.",

Cyclohexane is present in all crude oils in concentrations of 0.1-1.0% and it can be released to the environment in volcanic emissions, tobacco smoke and plant volatiles. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 96.9 mm Hg at 25 °C indicates cyclohexane will exist solely in the vapor phase in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase cyclohexane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.3 days. Some vapor-phase absorption to ambient surfaces may occur. If released to soil, cyclohexane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon estimated Koc values of 150 and 350. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an experimental Henry's Law constant of 0.15 atm-cu m/mole. Cyclohexane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Available biodegradation screening tests have conflicting results concerning the ready biodegradability of cyclohexane. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, only 8% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating not-readily biodegradable. In contrast, OECD Method 301F (Manometric Respirometry Test) observed 77% degradation after 28 days. Little mineralization of cyclohexane was detected in a single soil biodegradation test. If released into water, cyclohexane is expected to adsorb moderately to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.7 hrs and 3.6 days, respectively. A BCF range of 31-129 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to high. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to cyclohexane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where cyclohexane is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to cyclohexane via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing cyclohexane. The general population may also be exposed to cyclohexane due to its presence in gasoline. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase cyclohexane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.3 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 6.97X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 °C(3). Cyclohexane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Laboratory studies have suggested that adsorption from the gas-phase in the atmosphere to ambient surfaces may have some importance as an environmental fate process(5). Cyclohexane can contribute to the formation of photochemical smog when it reacts with other volatile organic carbon compounds in the air(6).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Thus, it does not support growth of the degrading organism themselves, but rather are metabolized during the course of the microorganisms growth on another, usually similar, substrate. Initial attack involves oxygenation and subsequent ring cleavage to simple, readily degradable acids(1). 10% degradation in 12 hours was reported using microorganisms isolated from a brackish creek in an area continuously exposed to oil(3). Only slight degradation of cyclohexane was noted in a screening test utilizing a benzene-acclimated activated sludge inoculum(4) and it was listed as degradation resistant according to the MITI test, a screening test of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry(5). Only one biodegradability test was reported in soil in which it was listed as nondegradable with only 0.3% mineralization occurring in 10 wk(6). When incubated at 23 °C with natural flora in groundwater in the presence of other components of high octane gasoline, 45% degradation was reported after 8 days(7). Cyclohexane, added as a component of gasoline, underwent 45% biodegradation after 192 hrs using microorganisms isolated from groundwater contaminated by a gasoline pipeline break(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Cyclohexane was qualitatively detected in houses that had recently used an oil-based floor finish(3). The mean concentration of cyclohexane in indoor air of 3 Italian cities, March, 1995, was 4.5, 5.7, and 5.6 ug/cu m(4). Cyclohexane concentrations of 340-380 ug/cu m were detected in living room and bedroom air of homes in Melbourne, Australia 2 days after construction(5); concentrations fell to <1 ug/cu 17 days later(5). A mean cyclohexane concentration of 2.90 ug/cu (maximum concentration 52 ug/cu m) was detected in indoor air of homes in suburban and rural New Jersey(6). Cyclohexane was detected (detection limit of 0.015 ug/cu m) in indoor air samples at 70 of 75 homes in Ottawa, Canada during winter 2002-2003 monitoring at a concentration range of 0.015-54.12 ug/cu m (mean concentration of 6.58 ug/cu m)(7).",
