It is one of the most widely used SGAs. [Paliperidone], another commonly used SGA, is the primary active metabolite of risperidone (i.e. 9-hydroxyrisperidone).  Schizophrenia and various mood disorders are thought to be caused by an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively. Risperidone is thought to reduce this overactivity through inhibition of dopaminergic D2 receptors and serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors in the brain.  Risperidone binds with a very high affinity to 5-HT2A receptors, approximately 10-20 fold greater than the drug's binding affinity to D2 receptors, and carries lesser activity at several off-targets which may responsible for some of its undesirable effects.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In one open-label study, an annual incidence of tardive dyskinesia of 0.3% was reported in patients with schizophrenia who received approximately 8-9 mg of oral risperidone daily for at least 1 year. The prevalence of this syndrome appears to be highest among geriatric patients (particularly females). The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible also appear to increase with the duration of therapy and cumulative dose of antipsychotic agents administered; however, the syndrome may occur, although much less frequently, after relatively short periods of treatment with low dosages.",

Risperidone has a high binding affinity for serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors when compared to dopaminergic D2 receptors in the brain. Risperidone binds to D2 receptors with a lower affinity than first-generation antipsychotic drugs, which bind with very high affinity. A reduction in extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone, when compared to its predecessors, is likely a result of its moderate affinity for dopaminergic D2 receptors.",

The main metabolic pathway is through hydroxylation of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone by the enzyme, CYP 2D6. A minor metabolic pathway is through N-dealkylation. The main metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, has similar pharmacological activity as risperidone. Consequently, the clinical effect of the drug results from the combined concentrations of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone.  CYP 2D6, also called debrisoquin hydroxylase, is the enzyme responsible for metabolism of many neuroleptics, antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, and other drugs. CYP 2D6 is subject to genetic polymorphism (about 6%-8% of Caucasians, and a very low percentage of Asians, have little or no activity and are \"poor metabolizers\") and to inhibition by a variety of substrates and some non-substrates, notably quinidine. Extensive CYP 2D6 metabolizers convert risperidone rapidly into 9-hydroxyrisperidone, whereas poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers convert it much more slowly. Although extensive metabolizers have lower risperidone and higher 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations than poor metabolizers, the pharmacokinetics of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone combined, after single and multiple doses, are similar in extensive and poor metabolizers.",

            "Description": "In medicine, the term \"mechanism of action\" (also called MOA) is used to describe how a drug or other substance produces an effect in the body. For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

                      "String": "Though its precise mechanism of action is not fully understood, current focus is on the ability of risperidone to inhibit the D2 dopaminergic receptors and 5-HT2A serotonergic receptors in the brain. Schizophrenia is thought to result from an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively.  D2 dopaminergic receptors are transiently inhibited by risperidone, reducing dopaminergic neurotransmission, therefore decreasing positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as delusions and hallucinations. Risperidone binds transiently and with loose affinity to the dopaminergic D2 receptor, with an ideal receptor occupancy of 60-70% for optimal effect. Rapid dissociation of risperidone from the D2 receptors contributes to decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which occur with permanent and high occupancy blockade of D2 dopaminergic receptors. Low-affinity binding and rapid dissociation from the D2 receptor distinguish risperidone from the traditional antipsychotic drugs. A higher occupancy rate of D2 receptors is said to increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and is therefore to be avoided.    Increased serotonergic mesocortical activity in schizophrenia results in negative symptoms, such as depression and decreased motivation. The high-affinity binding of risperidone to 5-HT2A receptors leads to a decrease in serotonergic activity. In addition, 5-HT2A receptor blockade results in decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, likely by increasing dopamine release from the frontal cortex, and not the nigrostriatal tract. Dopamine level is therefore not completely inhibited. Through the above mechanisms, both serotonergic and D2 blockade by risperidone are thought to synergistically work to decrease the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms.    Risperidone has also been said to be an antagonist of alpha-1 (α1), alpha-2 (α2), and histamine (H1) receptors. Blockade of these receptors is thought to improve symptoms of schizophrenia, however the exact mechanism of action on these receptors is not fully understood at this time.",

Levels of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptors in forebrain regions of juvenile rats were quantified after 3 weeks of treatment with three different doses of risperidone (0.3, 1.0 and 3.0mg/kg). Findings were compared to previously reported changes in 5-HT receptors after risperidone treatment (3.0mg/kg) in adult rat brain. The three doses of risperidone selectively and dose-dependently increased levels of 5-HT(1A) receptors in medial-prefrontal and dorsolateral-frontal cortices of juvenile animals. The higher doses (1.0 and 3.0mg/kg) of risperidone also increased 5-HT(1A) receptor binding in hippocampal CA(1) region of juvenile but not adult rats. In contrast, the three doses of risperidone significantly reduced 5-HT(2A) labeling in medial-prefrontal and dorsolateral-frontal cortices in juvenile as well as in adult animals in an equipotent fashion. 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptors in other forebrain regions were not altered by repeated risperidone treatment. These findings indicate that there are differential effects of risperidone on 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptors in juvenile animals, and that the 5-HT system in developing animals is more sensitive than adults to the long-term effects of risperidone.",

At clinically effective doses, these agents produce extensive blockade of serotonin (5-HT)(2A) receptors, direct or indirect stimulation of 5-HT(1A) receptors, and to a lesser extent, reduction in dopamine (DA) D(2) receptor-mediated neurotransmission. This contrasts with typical APDs, for example haloperidol and perphenazine, which are mainly DA D(2/)D(3) receptor antagonists and have weaker, if any, potency as 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists. Some, but not all, atypical APDs are also effective 5-HT(2C) receptor inverse agonists or neutral antagonists, 5-HT(6) or 5-HT(7) receptor antagonists. This diverse action on 5-HT receptors may contribute to significant differences in efficacy and tolerability among the atypical APDs. There is considerable preclinical and some clinical evidence that effects on 5-HT receptors contribute to the low risk of producing extrapyramidal side effects, which is the defining characteristic of an atypical APD, the lack of elevation in plasma prolactin levels (with risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone being exceptions), antipsychotic action, and ability to improve some domains of cognition in patients with schizophrenia. The serotonergic actions of the atypical APDs, especially 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonism, are particularly important to the differential effects of typical and atypical APDs to overcome the effects of acute or subchronic administration of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, such as phencyclidine, ketamine, and dizocipline (MK-801). 5-HT(1A) receptor stimulation and 5-HT(6) and 5-HT(7) receptor antagonism may contribute to beneficial effects of these agents on cognition. In particular, 5-HT(7) receptor antagonism may be the basis for the pro-cognitive effects of the atypical APD, amisulpride, a D(2)/D(3) receptor antagonist, which has no effect on other 5-HT receptor. 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonism appears to contribute to the weight gain produced by some atypical APDs and may also affect cognition and psychosis via its influence on cortical and limbic dopaminergic activity.",

Because paliperidone differs from risperidone by only a single hydroxyl group, questions have been raised as to whether there are significant differences in the effects elicited between these two drugs.  /The researchers/ compared the relative efficacies of paliperidone versus risperidone to regulate several cellular signalling pathways coupled to four selected GPCR targets that are important for either therapeutic or adverse effects: human dopamine D2 , human serotonin 2A receptor subtype (5-HT2A ), human serotonin 2C receptor subtype and human histamine H1 receptors. Whereas the relative efficacies of paliperidone and risperidone were the same for some responses, significant differences were found for several receptor-signalling systems, with paliperidone having greater or less relative efficacy than risperidone depending upon the receptor-response pair. Interestingly, for 5-HT2A -mediated recruitment of beta-arrestin, 5-HT2A -mediated sensitization of ERK, and dopamine D2 -mediated sensitization of adenylyl cyclase signalling, both paliperidone and risperidone behaved as agonists. These results suggest that the single hydroxyl group of paliperidone promotes receptor conformations that can differ from those of risperidone leading to differences in the spectrum of regulation of cellular signal transduction cascades. Such differences in signalling at the cellular level could lead to differences between paliperidone and risperidone in therapeutic efficacy or in the generation of adverse effects.",

Twenty patients with psychotic disorders, on therapy with risperidone, were studied. All patients had been receiving risperidone for at least 2.5 months, and the median daily dose of risperidone was 3 mg (range 1-10). Morning serum samples for prolactin were analyzed and investigated in relation to the serum concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone. Elevated prolactin levels were found in 17 (85%) of the patients. Levels of prolactin were positively correlated to the 9-hydroxyrisperidone serum concentration (r(s) = 0.48, p = 0.03) and to the daily dose of risperidone (r(s) = 0.51, p = 0.03), but did not correlate to the risperidone serum concentration. The present results suggest that 9-hydroxyrisperidone and not risperidone is the main contributor to the increased serum levels of prolactin observed in many risperidone-treated patients.",

Subjective cognitive dysfunction was comprehensively assessed using the Frankfurt Complaint Questionnaire (FCQ). The severity of subjective cognitive deficits was compared between the groups with and without akathisia using analysis of covariance with relevant variables as covariates. The akathisia group (n = 25) scored significantly higher on the total FCQ score than the non-akathisia group (n = 42) (P < 0.05). In phenomenological subscale scores, the akathisia group had significantly higher scores on various subscales, i.e. 'anxiety', 'disorder of selective attention', 'deterioration of discrimination', 'perceptual disorder' and 'disorder of coping responses' than the non-akathisia group (P < 0.05). These results suggest that akathisia is significantly associated with a variety of subjective cognitive-perceptual deficits. Early therapeutic interventions for akathisia should be performed considering its significant association with the subjective cognitive dysfunction and the impairment of coping responses.",

Thirty participants meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition criteria for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, or bipolar disorder with psychosis were enrolled. At baseline, subjects were antipsychotic free. Subjects were evaluated before and after 4 weeks of risperidone treatment. Assessments included symptom ratings along with testosterone, estradiol, prolactin, osteocalcin (marker of bone formation), and n-telopeptide crosslinks (NTx marker of bone resorption). Primary analysis examined the impact of risperidone treatment on change in the bone markers and hormone levels from pre to post treatment. Prolactin levels significantly increased from 12.1 +or - 1.9 ng/ml to 65.7 + or -  12.2 ng/mL after treatment (p < 0.001). NTx markers of bone resorption significantly decreased from 18.31 + or - 1.49 nM bone collagen equivalent (BCE) before treatment to 15.50 + or - 1.22 nM BCE after treatment in the study sample as a whole (p < 0.05). A trend was observed indicating that NTx may increase in individuals who have the greatest increases in prolactin after treatment r = 0.33, p = 0.07). These findings suggest that prolactin elevation is associated with changes in bone physiology very early in the course of treatment with risperidone. Bone resorption decreased in many subjects but higher levels of bone resorption occurred in patients with the greatest increases in prolactin. This may have important implications for prolactin monitoring or the periodic assessment of osteoporosis-related outcomes in patients requiring extended treatment.",

Serum prolactin, risperidone, and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of risperidone treatment (mean dosage, 0.06 +/- 0.03 mg/kg/d). After 24 weeks of treatment, prolactin was measured in a subsample of 15 children. Adverse effects were evaluated using a clinician-rated survey. Mean +/- SD prolactin levels increased from 7.8 +/- 8.0 ng/mL at baseline to 33.2 +/- 12.8 ng/mL at week 8 (P < 0.001), with a slight decrease to 28.8 +/- 13.6 ng/mL at week 24. At week 8, serum prolactin level was positively correlated with dose per kilogram (r = 0.648, P < 0.001), number of functional CYP2D6 genes (J = 2.117, P = 0.034), and serum 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentration (r = 0.664, P = 0.001) and was negatively correlated with the risperidone/9-hydroxyrisperidone ratio (r = -0.571, P = 0.004) but not with risperidone concentration (r = -0.243, P = 0.264) nor age (r = 0.072, P = 0.733). Prolactin elevation was not associated with adverse effects. Low-to-intermediate doses of risperidone induced a 4-fold prolactin increase in children without a clear development of tolerance up to 6 months. CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolism may be a risk factor for more pronounced prolactin elevation.",

A clinically relevant dose of risperidone (0.03 mg/kg, iv) did not affect the ventricular repolarization process, whereas the supra-therapeutic doses (0.3 and 3 mg/kg, iv) prolonged the duration of monophasic action potential of the ventricle. Furthermore, the terminal repolarization period, an index of extent of electrical vulnerability, was prolonged after the supra-therapeutic doses. In contrast, therapeutic to supra-therapeutic doses of olanzapine (0.03-3 mg/kg, iv) hardly affected the ventricular repolarization process.

In addition, Risperdal Consta produced an increase in a marker of cellular proliferation in renal tissue in males in the 1-year toxicity study and in renal tumor-bearing males in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at 40 mg/kg administered IM every 2 weeks. (Cellular proliferation was not measured at the low dose or in females in either study.)  The effect dose for osteodystrophy and the tumor findings is 8 times the IM maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (50 mg) on a mg/m2 basis and is associated with a plasma exposure (AUC) 2 times the expected plasma exposure (AUC) at the IM MRHD. The no-effect dose for these findings was 5 mg/kg (equal to the IM MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). Plasma exposure (AUC) at the no-effect dose was one third the expected plasma exposure (AUC) at the IM MRHD.  Neither the renal or adrenal tumors, nor osteodystrophy, were seen in studies of orally administered risperidone. Osteodystrophy was not observed in dogs at doses up to 14 times (based on AUC) the IM MRHD in a 1-year toxicity study.  The renal tubular and adrenomedullary tumors in male rats and other tumor findings are described in more detail in Section 13.1 (Carcinogenicity, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility).

The main objective of this naturalistic study was to investigate the variables associated with two plasma ratios: the plasma R:9-OHR concentration ratio and the total concentration-to-dose (C:D) ratio. These ratios were studied as continuous measures by linear regression analyses and as three dichotomous variables in logistic regression analyses: R:9-OHR ratio >1 (indicative of lack of CYP2D6 activity), C:D ratio >14 (indicative of diminished R elimination), and C:D ratio <3.5 (indicative of increased R elimination). Plasma R levels; genotypes for CYP2D6, CYP3A5; and ABCB1 genes, and co-medication, including CYP inhibitors and CYP3A inducers, were studied in 277 patients. Almost all CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs) had an inverted R:9-OHR ratio (>1). Having a CYP2D6 PM phenotype was strongly associated with a C:D ratio >14 (OR=8.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]=2.0-32.7), indicating diminished R elimination. CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs) did not exhibit an increased R elimination. Some ABCB1 (or MDR1) variants were significantly associated with increased R:9-OHR ratios and decreased C:D ratios, but the results were neither consistent nor robust. Taking CYP inhibitors was significantly associated with a C:D ratio >14 (OR=3.8; CI=1.7-8.7) and with an inverted R:9-OHR ratio. Taking CYP3A inducers was significantly associated with a C:D ratio <3.5 (OR=41.8; CI=12.7-138), indicating increased R elimination. Female gender and old age appeared to be associated with a lower R elimination. Our study indicated that the CYP2D6 PM phenotype may have a major role in personalizing R doses, whereas the CYP3A5 PM phenotype probably has no role. CYP inducers and inhibitors appear to be relevant to R dosing. New studies are needed, particularly to further assess the role of the CYP2D6 UM phenotype and ABCB1 variants in R pharmacokinetics.",

                          "String": "Risperidone's production and use as an antipsychotic may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.6X10-11 mm Hg at 25 °C indicates risperidone will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase risperidone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Risperidone does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, risperidone is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.3X10+6. The estimated pKa of risperidone is 8.76, indicating that this compound will exist partially in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of the neutral form of risperidone from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-16 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from moist soil of the ion form is not expected because the base exists as a cation and cations do not volatilize. Risperidone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, risperidone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant and pKa. An estimated BCF of 93 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to risperidone may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where risperidone is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to risperidone via medical administration of this compound for its use as an antipsychotic. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",
