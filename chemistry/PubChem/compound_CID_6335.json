For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

CAUTION: Hydrogen (UN1049), Deuterium (UN1957), Hydrogen, refrigerated liquid (UN1966) and Methane (UN1971) are lighter than air and will rise. Hydrogen and Deuterium fires are difficult to detect since they burn with an invisible flame. Use an alternate method of detection (thermal camera, broom handle, etc.) Vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back. Cylinders exposed to fire may vent and release flammable gas through pressure relief devices. Containers may explode when heated. Ruptured cylinders may rocket. (ERG, 2016)",

Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. Do not direct water at source of leak or safety devices; icing may occur. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks engulfed in fire. For massive fire, use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2016)",

All equipment used when handling the product must be grounded. Do not touch or walk through spilled material. Stop leak if you can do it without risk. If possible, turn leaking containers so that gas escapes rather than liquid. Use water spray to reduce vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. Avoid allowing water runoff to contact spilled material. Do not direct water at spill or source of leak. Prevent spreading of vapors through sewers, ventilation systems and confined areas. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. CAUTION: When in contact with refrigerated/cryogenic liquids, many materials become brittle and are likely to break without warning. (ERG, 2016)",

In this study, the animals were exposed to 28,700 ppm methylacetylene 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 6 months. Rats and dogs reached an early plane of anesthesia (within 30 minutes) and generally recovered rapidly after each exposure. Forty percent of the rats and none of the dogs died over the course of the study. Gross pathology of the rats that died was limited to the lungs, which appeared dark red and remained distended when the thorax was opened. In exposed rats that survived to termination, the lungs also were discolored and remained distended. Microscopic pathology of the lungs showed definite pulmonary irritation. The remaining organs appeared to be within normal limits. There was no effect of treatment on any hematological, urine or biochemical index of toxicity in the dogs. The gross appearance of all organs examined and microscopic examinations of the lung, liver, kidney, heart, spleen and GI tract in exposed dogs were normal ...[EPA/Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics; High Production Volume (HPV) Challenge Program's Robust Summaries and Test Plans for Acetylene (December 2003).

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.31X10+3 at 25 °C indicates 1-propyne will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase 1-propyne will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.7 days. 1-Propyne does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1-propyne is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 77. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.011 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, 1-propyne is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 41 min and 2.5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Alkynes are generally resistant to hydrolysis; therefore, 1-propyne is not expected to hydrolyze in the environment. Occupational exposure to 1-propyne may occur through inhalation with this compound at workplaces where 1-propyne is produced or used. The most likely pathway by which the general public is exposed to 1-propyne is by inhalation due to the release of this substance from combustion fuels, biomass emissions and cigarette smoke. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It sets up criteria for the classification of chemicals for physical-chemical, health, and environmental hazards of chemical substances and mixtures and sets up standardized hazard information to facilitate global trade of chemicals.  Please note that obsolete codes are added in this classification for completeness purposes, as they are still in use. Any obsolete codes are annotated as such.",
