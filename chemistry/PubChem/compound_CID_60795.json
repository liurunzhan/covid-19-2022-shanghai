ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (eg, heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (eg, pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. ABILIFY (aripiprazole) is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. /Included in label/",

Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of adjunctive ABILIFY or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber.

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Among the atypical antipsychotics, aripiprazole displays the lowest affinity for alpha(1)adrenergic (alpha(1)), histamine (H1) and muscarinic (M1) receptors. This combination of effects may be responsible for its efficacy in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and in bipolar disorder. ...Other early data suggest that aripiprazole may induce reductions in plasma prolactin, as well as in plasma glucose and lipid profiles ...",

In other studies of antipsychotic medication in pregnancy, children are at risk of extrapyramidal or withdrawal symptoms. In animal studies of pregnancy, aripiprazole was associated with a number of malformations and fetal death at doses higher than the maximum recommended human dose. Aripiprazole should only be prescribed in pregnancy if the benefits outweigh the risks. Neonates with third trimester exposure to aripiprazole may show extrapyramidal or withdrawal symptoms of varying severity. These symptoms may resolve in hours or require extended hospital care. Aripiprazole's effect on labor and delivery has not been investigated. Aripiprazole is present in human breast milk and so patients should either stop breastfeeding or stop taking aripiprazole depending on the risk and benefit to mother and child. Pharmacokinetic properties in patients 10-17 years of age are similar to that of adults once body weight has been corrected for. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients however aripiprazole is not approved for Alzheimer's associated psychosis. Patients calssified as CYP2D6 poor metabolizers should be prescribed half the regular dose of aripiprazole. Hepatic and renal function as well as sex, race, and smoking status do not affect dosage requirements for aripiprazole.",

                          "String": "IDENTIFICATION AND USE: Aripiprazole is used IM for the acute management of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, mixed or manic, in adults for whom treatment with aripiprazole is appropriate and who require an IM antipsychotic agent for rapid control of behaviors that interfere with diagnosis and care (e.g., threatening behaviors, escalating or urgently distressing behavior, self-exhausting behavior). Aripiprazole is used orally for the acute treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder. Aripiprazole is used orally as an adjunct to antidepressants for the acute treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. Aripiprazole is used orally as monotherapy or as an adjunct to either lithium or valproate for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder with or without psychotic features in adults and pediatric patients 10-17 years of age. The drug also is used orally as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adults and pediatric patients 10-17 years of age. Aripiprazole is used orally for the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults and adolescents 13-17 years of age. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including aripiprazole. Two possible cases of NMS occurred during aripiprazole treatment in the premarketing worldwide clinical database. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death.   Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. ANIMAL STUDIES: In female mice, the incidences of pituitary gland adenomas and mammary gland adenocarcinomas and adenoacanthomas were increased at dietary dose of 3 to 30 mg/kg/day. Female rats were treated with oral doses of 2, 6, and 20 mg/kg/day of aripiprazole from 2 weeks prior to mating through day 7 of gestation. Estrus cycle irregularities and increased corpora lutea were seen at all doses, but no impairment of fertility was seen. Increased pre-implantation loss was seen at 6 and 20 mg/kg, and decreased fetal weight was seen at 20 mg/kg. Pregnant rabbits were treated with oral doses of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day of aripiprazole during the period of organogenesis. Decreased maternal food consumption and increased abortions were seen at 100 mg/kg. Treatment caused increased fetal mortality (100 mg/kg), decreased fetal weight (30 and 100 mg/kg), increased incidence of a skeletal abnormality (fused sternebrae at 30 and 100 mg/kg) and minor skeletal variations (100 mg/kg). Aripiprazole and a metabolite (2,3-DCPP) were clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in CHL cells with and without metabolic activation. The metabolite, 2,3-DCPP, produced increase in numerical aberrations in the in vitro assay in CHL cells in the absence of metabolic activation. A positive response was obtained in the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice, however,the response was shown to be due to a mechanism not considered relevant to humans.",

Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.  The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses."

In female rats, the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas was increased at a dietary dose of 10 mg/kg/day (0.1 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 3 times the MRHD based on mg/m2); and the incidences of adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas were increased at an oral dose of 60 mg/kg/day (14 times human exposure at MRHD based on AUC and 19 times the MRHD based on mg/m2). Proliferative changes in the pituitary and mammary gland of rodents have been observed following chronic administration of other antipsychotic agents and are considered prolactin-mediated. Serum prolactin was not measured in the aripiprazole carcinogenicity studies. Serum prolactin was not increased in female rats in 4-week and 13-week dietary studies at the dose associated with mammary gland tumors. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown.",

Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide.

Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.  The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.2X10-13 mm Hg at 25 Â°C indicates aripiprazole will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase aripiprazole will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Aripiprazole contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, aripiprazole is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 2.5X10+4. The estimated pKa1 of aripiprazole is 7.46, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.7X10-17 atm-cu m/mole. Aripiprazole is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, aripiprazole is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 1500 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to aripiprazole may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where aripiprazole is produced or used. Exposure to aripiprazole among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug, an antipsycholtic. (SRC)",

Aripiprazole is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 3.2X10-13 mm Hg at 25 Â°C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(2). Biodegradation data in soil were not available(SRC, 2015).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",
